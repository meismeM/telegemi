For example information about naturally occurring elements in living organisms, chemical bonding, molecules, acids ,bases and other related things can be studied using the tools and principles of chemistry. Other scientific concept like conversion of radiant energy into organic molecules by photo-synthesis is studied with the knowledge of chemistry and Physics.\n1.2 Why do we study Biology?\n At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\texplain why biology is studied\n\u2022\tgive examples of biological application Objectives\nHuman beings have an inborn curiosity about the natural world \nthat leads them to study about living organisms and their habitats. \nStudying biology helps to understand how living things work, how they function and interact with the environment. Biology touches our everyday life in many ways. For example, biologists have discovered drugs that are used to treat different human diseases. Many biologists are working on problems that critically affect our lives, such as how our animals and plants body work, how ecosystems work, how advancements in genetics and cell biology are transforming to medicine and agriculture, as well as the use of forensics biology to investigate crime, Furthermore, studies how ecology is helping societies evaluate environmental issues, such as global warming, how fermentation is used to produce alcoholic drinks such as beer and wine. In addition, biological studies are  used in treating patients suffering from AIDS, tuberculosis, and some types of cancer.\n1.3. The Scientific Method\nBiology is a science of inquiry.\nWhat comes to your mind when you hear the word science?Biologists are always curious about why things happen or how things            Activity 1.2: Group \nwork\nMake a group of students \nand discuss how the \nknowledge of    biology can be applied in the fields of agriculture, medicine, food processing, food preparation, preparation of beverage etc. and present it to your class.\nApplication of Biology in our \nday to day life:\n\u2022 Wine-making, the \nbrewing, the baking of bread and the production of cheese all depend on fermentation processes brought about by yeasts, other fungi and bacteria, or enzymes from these organisms.\n\u2022 Antibiotics, such as penicillin, are produced by mould fungi or bacteria.\n\u2022 The production of industrial chemicals such as citric acid or lactic acid needs bacteria or fungi to bring about essential chemical changes.\n\u2022 Sewage disposal depends on bacteria in the filter beds to form the basis of the food chain that purifies the effluent.\n\u2022 Discovery of the structure of DNA and forensic analysis of DNA samples from crime scenes.Attention\n At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\texplain about scientific method\n\u2022\texplain about the meaning of hypothesis\n\u2022\tpractice about formulating hypothesis\n\u2022\tpractice doing scientific experiment and drawing a bar graph Objectives\n2\nGrade 9 Biology Unit One: Introduction to Biology  "

The scientific method involves a series of steps that guide scientists through such scientific investigations. Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it. The general steps of the Scientific methods are:\nObservation\nThe scientific study begins with careful observations (often a problem \nto solve) that leads to a question. The observations can be made either directly (e.g. using your sense organs) or indirectly using scientific tools such as microscopes.\nAsking Questions\nThe observations usually lead the scientist to ask questions (inquiry).\nForming of a hypothesis\nA hypothesis is proposed scientific explanations (possible answers) \nfor a set of question (s).To solve a problem, one can propose several hypotheses. Scientific hypotheses should be testable.\nTesting the hypothesis\nHypothesis can be tested through experimentation. Any scientific \nexperiment must have the ability to be duplicated because the \u201canswer\u201d the scientist comes up with (whether it supports or rejects the original hypothesis) can\u2019t become part of the scientific knowledge unless other scientists can perform the same experiment and achieve the similar results. If a hypothesis is not supported by experimental data, one can propose a new hypothesis.\nMaking conclusions about the findings\nScientists consider their original hypotheses and ask whether they \ncould still be right in light of the new information gathered during the experiment. If so, the hypotheses can remain as possible explanations for how things work. If not, scientists reject the hypotheses and try to come up with alternate explanations (new hypotheses) that can explain what they\u2019ve seen.\nCommunicating the findings\nWhen scientists complete some work, they write a paper that explains \nexactly what they did and the results they obtained. Then, they submit the paper to a scientific journal in their field. In addition, the findings will be printed in scientific journals and assist teachers and students in the field.\nExample of a hypothesis testing in everyday life\nSuppose you want to use your torch (hand lamp) to find a missing pen \nHypothesis: a proposed \nscientific explanationKey Terms\n3\nGrade 9 Biology Unit One: Introduction to Biology  "

            "text": "The Microscope\nOne of the most important tools of the biologist is a microscope. A \nmicroscope is an instrument used to study objects that are too small to be seen with a naked eye. The microscope magnifies the image of small objects making them visible to the human eye. For example, microscopes are used to observe the shape of bacteria, fungi and parasites.\nThere are several kinds of microscopes. The major types are:\n\u2022 light microscope and\n\u2022 electron microscope\nA light microscope is called light microscope because it uses a beam \nof light to view specimens. There are two types of light microscopes, \nSimple light microscope which consists of a single lens while a compound light microscope consists of two or more glass lenses.\nA compound light microscope is the most common microscope used \nin biology. It consists of two lens systems (a combination of lenses) to magnify the image of an object up to 2000x. Each lens has a different magnifying power. A compound light microscope with a single eye-piece is called monocular; one with two eye-pieces is said to be binocular.\nElectron microscopes on the other hand use a beam of electrons \n(instead of a beam of light) and electromagnets (instead of glass lenses) \nto enlarge the image of an object. These microscopes provide a higher magnification than light microscopes and are used for observing extremely small micro-organisms such as viruses.\nGlass slides and cover slips:  The microscope slides are used to \nsupport an specimens being examined under the microscope.  \nThe cover slips are the small square or circle shaped thin glass sheets \nthat are used to cover specimens on the glass slide  to protect from further addition of any chemical or dirt and it is also used to protect the microscope and prevent the slide from drying by locking the \nmoisture.  Cover slides provide better view under the microscope.   \nAlthough the tool most closely associated with a biologist is the microscope, there are several common tools used by biologists in the laboratory and on field.Activity 1.6 Classwork\nHow many lens does hand lens have? \nDiscuss with your friend next to you.\nFigure  1.3.

An autoclave sterilizes contaminated \nmaterials including culture media, and bacterial spores by exposing \nthem to high temperatures and highly pressurized steam.\n                         \n  Culturing is the procedure used to grow microorganisms in a \ncontrolled environment. Many microorganisms reproduce very \nquickly. Culturing of micro-organisms also have important function like in medicine (Penicillin) and for food (beverage) preparation. Wine and beer making uses culturing on a large scale, as it does in cheese making, bio-fuel production, and many other endeavors.\nThere are many ways of killing microorganisms, including chemical \ndisinfectants, flame, dry or wet heat, ultraviolet light, and ionizing radiation such as X-rays or gamma rays. The problem is, some bacteria form spores, which are resistant to chemical disinfectants, including bleach.

For example, every muscle in your body \nis powered by the energy you obtain from your diet. Some organisms use energy from the sunlight to make their foods through the process of photosynthesis. Such organisms, for example plants, are known as producers or autotrophs. Other organisms cannot make their own food but consume others. Such organisms are known as consumers or heterotrophs. \nAll living organisms respond to stimuli: organisms can detect or \nsense stimuli (change) in the internal or external environment and \nmake appropriate responses.\nAll living things can grow: Growth is a permanent increase in size \nand mass due to an increase in cell number or cell size or both. \nEven bacteria and single-celled creatures show an increase in size. Multicellular organisms which increase the number of cells in their bodies become more complicated and change their shape and size.\nAll living things can reproduce: Reproduction is the process that \nmakes more of the same kind of organism. Single-celled organisms may simply keep dividing into two. However, multicellular plants and animals may reproduce sexually or asexually.\nAll living things can excrete: Excretion is the removal of the \nmetabolic wastes produced in cells as a result of chemical reactions \n(metabolism).  For example, respiration and other chemical reactions in the cells produce waste products such as carbon dioxide. Living organisms expel such substances from their bodies in various ways.\nAll living things display ordered complexity: All living things \nare both complex and highly ordered. The levels of organization in \nbiological systems begin with atoms and molecules and increase in complexity. Your body is composed of many different kinds of cells each containing many complex molecular structures. Many non-living things may also be complex, but they do not exhibit this degree of ordered complexity.\nMost living things maintain homeostasis: Most organisms maintain \nrelatively constant internal conditions that are different from their \nenvironment.

One tool biologists use to organize and understand living organisms is classification. Classification is the process of grouping things based on their similarities. The science of naming, identifying and classifying organisms is known as taxonomy. Scientists who study taxonomy are called taxonomists. Biologists classify organisms into different categories mostly by judging the degrees of their apparent similarities and differences. These include the external and internal structures of the organism as well as where the organism lives. Taxonomists also consider the genetic makeup of organisms to reveal their evolutionary relationships to other organisms. The assumption is that the greater the degree of physical similarity between them, the closer their biological relationship is. They try to identify and classify organisms based on a number of features (e.g., morphological, physiological, molecular, behavioural, and/or ecological characters).\nFigure 2.1.

Taxonomic hierarchies in biological classification\nThousands of years ago, the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 \nBC) developed the first widely accepted biological classification \nsystems. He used simple morphological characters to classify plants into trees, shrubs and herbs. He also divided animals into two groups -those which had red blood and those that did not have. Though it was useful for a while, Aristotle grouped some organisms that had very little in common. For example, he grouped birds, bats, and flying insects because they could fly. Later on in the 1700s, a Swedish Botanist Carolus Linnaeus (1707\u20131778), who is also known as the father of taxonomy, introduced a taxonomic hierarchy of classification. He was the first person to propose an orderly system for classifying organisms. \nTaxonomic hierarchy is the process of arranging various organisms \ninto successive levels of the biological classification either in a decreasing or an increasing order. In the Linnaean classification system, all organisms are placed in a ranked hierarchy. The kingdom is  ranked the highest followed by Phylum (division), class, order, family, genus, and species (Fig. 2.2). Each rank in a taxonomic hierarchy is termed taxon (plural, taxa). Linnaeus\u2019 developed a two Kingdom system of classification. He classified all living organisms under kingdoms Plantae and Animalia that included all plants and animals, respectively. This system did not distinguish between the eukaryotes and prokaryotes, unicellular and multicellular organisms; and photosynthetic (green algae) and non-photosynthetic (fungi) organisms.\nAt the broadest level, biologists divide the diversity of life into three \ndomains: Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Domain is the rank above kingdom. Every organism on Earth belongs to one of these three domains. The first two domains, Bacteria and Archaea, identify two very different groups of organisms that have prokaryotic cells, relatively small and simple cells that lack a nucleus or other compartments bounded by internal membranes. Archaea are prokaryotic as their cells have no nucleus and membrane bounded organelles. Their range of size is similar to that of bacteria. Many Archaea inhabit extreme environments. Bacteria are prokaryotic as their cells have no nucleus. They are all small organisms that vary in size between that of the largest virus and the smallest single-celled eukaryote. The major differences  At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\tdescribe taxonomic hierarchies Objectives Activity 2.4: Problem \nsolving\nRead a book or search in \nthe Internet on biological \nclassification.

For example, this framework allows biologists to study the relationship between birds and dinosaurs. Biologists have found that the bones of some dinosaurs have large internal spaces. So do the bones of birds. Because of these findings, some biologists believe that dinosaurs are more closely related to birds than to reptiles.\nTaxonomy can also be a useful tool for scientists who work in such \nareas as agriculture, forestry, and medicine. Taxonomy can also help the economy. For example, taxonomists can discover new sources of lumber, foods, medicines, and energy. For example, a taxonomist might know that a certain species of tree contains chemicals that make good disinfectants (e.g., Shiferaw/ Moringa- Moringa stenopetala). It \nis possible that a closely related plant species could have the same useful substances. So instead of having one source of chemicals, there may be two or more sources. At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022 describe the relevance of classification  Objectives\nActivity 2.5: Investigating\n1. Why and how do \nhuman beings classify organisms? \n2. Visit a library in your school or public library in your village, and write on the importance of biological classification and present your results to your classmates.  \n1. For which of the following purposes could taxonomy be used? \na. to determine whether a plant is safe to be planted in a schoolyard\nb. to find a new source for medicine that comes from plants\nc. to determine how closely related two species animals\nd. all of the above Self Assessment 2.3Have you ever asked yourself what a species is? What are the characteristic features of a species? The \nsmallest natural group of organisms is the species. A species can be defined as a group of organisms that \ncan reproduce to produce fertile offspring. Members of a species also often resemble each other very closely in appearance, unless humans have taken a hand in the breeding programs. All cats belong to the same species but there are wide variations in the appearance of different breeds. There are many other definitions of species; for example, phylogenetic species, morphological species, evolutionary species, systematic species, recognition species etc. However, for a biological species, members could reproduce to produce fertile offspring. Members of a species also often resemble each other very closely in appearance. Attention\n24\nGrade 9 Biology 24"

            "text": "Unit Two:  Characteristics and Classification of Organisms2.4 Linnaean system of nomenclature\nHow did Carl Linnaeus classify living organisms?\nLinnaeus was a Swedish naturalist who initially graduated in medicine \nbut became interested in plants. He travelled in Scandinavia, England and Eastern Europe, discovering and naming new plant species. In 1735 he published his Systema Naturae, in which he accurately \ndescribed 7700 plant species and classified them. He further grouped species into genera, genera into classes, and classes into orders. He also classified over 4000 animals, but rather less successfully into mammals, birds, insects and worms.\nLinnaeus refined and popularized the binomial system of naming \norganisms, in which the first name represents the genus and the second \nname the specific epithet. This system is still the official starting point for naming or revising the names of organisms. \nBinomial nomenclatureSpecies must be named in such a way that the name is recognized \nall over the world. For example, maize is named Bekolo in Amharic, \nBoqqollo (Badallaa) in Afan Oromo and Baddela in Sidaamu Afoo  \nand corn in American English etc. If you are not aware of these names, it could lead to confusion. If the botanical name, Zea mays, \nis used, however, there is no chance of error. As you all might know our country is endowed with cultural and linguistic diversities and each would have different names for the same species.  As a result, it would be difficult for a person to know the names given by the 80 plus ethnolinguistic groups in Ethiopia. Similarly, there are over thousands of languages in the African continent and beyond.\nTherefore, the Latin form of the name allows it to be used in all over \nthe world irrespective of language barriers. The similarity in size, shape, behaviour and colour makes it difficult to differentiate one species from the other.  Again, the use of the scientific name avoids such confusion.\nThe binomial system of naming species (introduced by Linnaeus) is \nan internationally agreed system in which the scientific name of an \norganism is made up of two parts showing the genus and the species.  At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022 describe the system of Linnaean nomenclature\n\u2022 explain how organisms are given scientific names.\n\u2022 write scientific names properly and give examples.

A genus (plural, genera) consists of \na group of similar species. The specific epithet sometimes describes a characteristic of the organism. For example, Enset, false banana, Ensete  ventricosum and Banana, Musa acuminate, belong to the same \nfamily (Musaceae).In writing a scientific name, the first letter of name of the genus is a capitalized letter and the specific epithet always starts with a small letter, for example, the scientific name of human beings is Homo sapiens. The scientific names are underlined when handwritten \nor italicized when printed. \n2.5 Common Ethiopian animals and plants\nEthiopia is endowed with high biological diversity (biodiversity) due to its geographical location, topographical diversity and diverse climatic features. The country is a hot spot for a diversity of wild plant and animal species with a high degree of endemicity. Furthermore, Ethiopia is a primary centre of diversity for field crops such as noug (Guizotia abyssinica), tef (Eragrostis tef) and the Ethiopian mustard (Brassica carinata). Besides, field crops such as barley, sorghum, durum wheat, finger millet, faba bean, chickpea, lentil, and cowpea have wide diversity in Ethiopia.

They \nsimplify the process of identification. Each key is made up of pairs of contrasting features (dichotomous means two branches), starting with quite general characteristics and progressing to more specific ones. By following the key and making appropriate choices it is possible to identify the organism correctly. Figure 2.3 shows an example of a dichotomous key that could be used to place an unknown vertebrate and unknown invertebrate in the correct class. Item 1 gives you a choice between two alternatives. If the animal is poikilothermic \n(cold-blooded), you move to item 2 and make a further choice. If it is a homoiothermic (warm-blooded), you move to item 4 for your next \nchoice. The same technique may be used for assigning an organism to its class, genus or species. However, the important features may not always be easy to see and you have to make use of less fundamental characteristics. \n1.

The main criteria for classification used by him include cell structure, body organization, mode of nutrition, reproduction and phylogenetic relationships.

Self Assessment 2.6Viruses are not included \nin any kingdom \u2013 they are \nnot considered to be living organisms because they lack key characteristics of living things. Viruses are particles that are not alive. They cause diseases and infections. Viruses are made up of nucleic acids, either DNA or RNA, surrounded by a protein coat. They are smaller than the tiniest bacterium. Most biologists agree that viruses are not alive because they don\u2019t grow, develop, or carry out respiration. All viruses replicate, or make copies of themselves. However, viruses need the help of living cells to copy themselves. In order to copy itself, a virus must enter a living cell. The cell in which a virus replicates is called the host cell.Attention\n29\nGrade 9 Biology 29"

Others, called algae, seem to be like plants except they do not \nhave roots, stems, or leaves. Algae are photosynthetic and autotrophic.

Hyphae play an important role in how they obtain food. \nFungi possess a cell wall that is made up of chitin and polysaccharides. Like animals, fungi are heterotrophic in nutrition. But unlike animals, \nfungi do not ingest (eat) their food. Instead, a fungus absorbs nutrients from the environment outside of its body. Many fungi accomplish this task by secreting powerful enzymes into their surroundings, digest compounds from a wide range of sources, living or dead. These enzymes break down complex molecules into smaller organic compounds that the fungi can absorb into their bodies and use (Figs 2.9 and 2.10). \nFigure 2.9. Examples of fungi\nMost fungi absorb soluble organic matter from dead substrates and hence are called saprophytes (decomposers). Decomposer fungi break down and absorb nutrients from non-living organic material, such as fallen logs, animal corpses, and the wastes of living organisms. Activity 2.15: Peer \nconferencing\nSo far, you have studied \nbacteria, and protists. In \nthis section, you will learn about the kingdom Fungi. Fungus is the singular of fungi.

Fungi use \na process called extracellular digestion to obtain nutrients. This means food is digested outside a fungus\u2019s cells and then the digested food is absorbed. For example, some hyphae of a fungus will grow into an orange. They release digestive enzymes into the orange that break down the large organic molecules into smaller molecules. These small molecules are absorbed into the hyphae and move into the flowing cytoplasm.\nFungi can also live with different living as parasites or mutualists. \nParasitic fungi absorb nutrients from the cells of living hosts. Some parasitic fungi are pathogenic, causing diseases in humans (Example: Candida albicans cause rush and Tinea pedis cause athlete\u2019s foot), \nanimals and plants. Mutualistic fungi also absorb nutrients from a host organism, but they reciprocate with actions that benefit the host. For example, mutualistic fungi that live inside certain termite species use their enzymes to break down wood, making food available for termites. Fungi can also live as symbionts in association with algae as lichens and with roots of higher plants as mycorrhiza.\nFungi can reproduce either asexually by vegetative means \n(fragmentation, fission and budding), asexual reproduction through spores formation and sexually.

            "text": "Unit Two:  Characteristics and Classification of Organismsis not straightforward, as there are exceptions to nearly every criterion \nfor distinguishing animals from other life forms. However, several characteristics of animals, when taken together, sufficiently define them.\nAnimals differ from both plants and fungi in their mode of nutrition. \nUnlike plants, animals are not photosynthetic. Animals consume food obtained from other organisms (i.e. they are heterotrophs).  But unlike fungi, most animals do not feed by absorption; instead, animals ingest their food and then use enzymes to digest it within their bodies.\nIn contrast to plants and fungi, however, animals lack the structural \nsupport of cell walls. Instead, animal cells are held together by structural proteins, the most abundant being collagen, which is found only in animals.\nMany animals have two types of specialized cells not seen in other \nmulticellular organisms: muscle cells and nerve cells. In most animals, these cells are organized into muscle tissue and nervous tissue, respectively, and are responsible for moving the body and conducting nerve impulses. \nThe ability to move and conduct nerve impulses underlies many of the \nadaptations that differentiate animals from plants and fungi, making muscle and nerve cells central to what it means to be an animal.\nMost animals reproduce sexually. Animals are very diverse. They are generally classified into two groups \nbased on the presence or absence of backbone as invertebrates (animals with no backbone) and vertebrates (animals with a backbone(Fig. 2.13 -2.15).  \nFigure 2.13.

Objectives\nAs stated in section 2.5 of this textbook, Ethiopia is known for high \ndegree speciesdiversity and endemcity.  However, only few studies \nhave been done to identify, name and classify the biodiversity at different levels (e.g., gene, species, and ecosystem).. Among the factors that led to inadequate level of studies done in Ethiopia in the field of biodiversity could be due to the few number of scientists educated and trained in taxonomy despite the country\u2019s rich biodiversity.\nYet, as the result of efforts made over the past six decades, our country \nhas trained and educated a couple of renowned taxonomists that contributed the publication of volumes of books on the Flora of Ethiopia, for example. Among these scientists are Dr. Mesfin Taddese, Professor Sebsebe Demissew, Professor Ensermu Kelbessa and Professor Silesh Nemomissa to mention a few of them.  In addition, there are few other zoologists like Professor  Abebe Getahun; who contributed to the field of animal taxonomy. Below, we will discuss briefly the contributions made by some distinguished Ethiopian taxonomists to the scientific community in general and Ethiopian society in particular.  \nActivity 2.22: Collaborative \nLearning \nRead a book or search on \nInternet about important fish \nspecies, mammals, and birds. \nThen list  their economic, \nmedicinal, aesthetic, cultural, spiritual, and/or ecological importance. \nActivity 2.23: Collaborative \nLearning \nDo you know any renowned \nEthiopian taxonomist?

Cell theory\n At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\tdescribe cell theory,\n\u2022\tname scientists who played a role in the discovery of the cell \ntheory. Objectives\nAn English scientist, Robert Hooke was the first to observe cells and \nto use the word cell for structures in living organisms. He did this \nin 1665 after examining thin slices of plant material cork. He was surprised by the regular appearance of the structure, which is \u2018pore like\u2019 regular structures that Hooke called \u2018cells\u2019 . Each cell appeared to be an empty box surrounded by a wall. Hooke had discovered and described a cell, without realizing that it is the fundamental unit of all living things. \nAfter Hooke discovered cells in the first half of the seventh century, \nother early Dutch Microbiologist Anton van Leeuwenhoek (1632\u20141723)   used his lenses in building numerous microscopes, some with magnifications approaching 300X.   In 1674 he likely observed protozoa for the first time and several years\u2019 later he observed bacteria. Those \u201cvery little animalcules\u201d he was able to isolate from different sources, such as rainwater, pond and well water, and the human mouth and intestine.  Leeuwenhoek is universally acknowledged as the father of microbiology because, he discovered micro-organisms like protists and bacteria.\nMore than 150 years later, German scientists, Matthias Schleiden and \nTheodor Schwann were the first to explain the basic views of what we now call cell theory.\nIn 1838, German botanist Matthias Schleiden, a botanist stated that Cell: is the smallest and \nthe basic unit of living \nthings. All living things are composed of cells. Unicellular organisms: living things consist of a single cell\nMulticellular organisms: \ngroups of living things composed of many cellsKey Terms\nActivity 3.2 : Group work\nDiscuss in group about the \ncell theory\nEnglish natural philosopher Robert Hooke was the first \nto observe cells in 1665, naming the shapes he saw in cork cellulae (Latin, \u201csmall rooms\u201d).They are known to us as cells.Attention\nFigure 3.1.

The two German biologists, established cells as the natural unit and function in living things, the entire animals and plants are made up of these cells. Then a German pathologist, Rudolf  Virchow (1856) established the idea that cells arise only by the division of existing cells. Based on the above discoveries, the principle of cell theory is developed. The cell theory states that:\n1. Living organisms are composed of one or more cells.\n2. Cells are the smallest unit of life\n3. Cells arise only by the division of a pre-existing cell.\nCells vary considerably in size and shape but they share certain common features:\n\u2022 Every living cell is surrounded by a membrane, which separates the cell contents from everything else outside.\n\u2022 Cells contain genetic material which stores all of the instructions needed for the cell\u2019s activities. Many of these activities are chemical reactions, catalysed by enzymes produced inside the cell.\n\u2022 Cells have their own energy release system that powers all of the cell\u2019s activities, So cells can be thought of as the smallest living structures \u2013 nothing smaller can survive.\n   3.3. Cell structure and function  \nCells have different structures which have different functions. The  organization of cells varies between different organisms. In multicellular organisms, some cells have the same shape and same function but other cells have different shapes and different functions. For example, in the human body, the shape and function of nerve cells are different from that of muscle cells.

It is also the site where several chemical reactions such \nas protein synthesis take place.\nNucleus\nNucleus is the largest organelle surrounded by the double-membrane. \nInside a nucleus, there are thread-like structures called chromosomes that contain a very long molecule of DNA ( Deoxyribonucleic acid). The nucleus determines what the cell will be, for example, a blood cell, a liver cell, a muscle cell or a nerve cell. The nucleus also controls cell division. Within a nucleus there is a darker area called the nucleolus, this is the site where new ribosomes are made.\nRibosomes\nRibosomes are small cellular structures that are found in large numbers \nin all cells. The function of ribosomes is to synthesize proteins. They are found either freely in the cytoplasm or attached to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.\nEndoplasmic Reticulum \nThe endoplasmic reticulum is a complex system of interconnected \ndouble membranes. They contain fluid-filled spaces between the membranes which allow materials to be transported throughout the cell. There are two distinct types of the endoplasmic reticulum\nRough Endoplasmic Reticulum   \nIt gets its name from the dotted appearance of its surface. These \ndotted structures on it are the ribosomes. Proteins can be made by these ribosomes. Proteins can be made and stored in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and transported around the cell in the small sacs called vesicles.\nSmooth endoplasmic reticulum\nThis is endoplasmic reticulum without ribosomes.

They \nstore and transport and ship materials where they need to go. For example, a protein made by the rough endoplasmic reticulum may be placed inside a transport vesicle and shipped to the Golgi bodies, where it would be modified and tagged for shipment elsewhere. These vesicles are found in the cell by fusing with the Golgi apparatus.\nGolgi apparatus (Golgi body, Golgi complex)\nGolgi apparatus is a smooth, concave, membranous structure. \nThe Golgi apparatus with the vesicles functions in the collection, packaging, and distribution of molecules within the cell or even outside the cell.\nProteins and lipids manufactured on the rough and smooth \nendoplasmic reticulum are transported into the Golgi apparatus and modified as they pass through it. These modified proteins and lipids are then packaged into vesicles that pinch off from the Golgi apparatus. These vesicles then diffuse to other locations in the cell, distributing the newly synthesized molecules to their appropriate place.\nMitochondria\nMitochondria are relatively large organelles found in the cells. It has \na double membrane; the outer one controls the entry and exit of materials. The inner membrane forms many folds on which some of the chemical reactions of respiration take place and the site for the synthesis of much energy.

Prokaryotic cells are usually much smaller than eukaryotic cells. They have a much simpler structure and are thought to be the first cells to have evolved. Prokaryotic cells such as bacterial cells don\u2019t have membrane-bound organelles or a nucleus. Eukaryotes such as plants and animals cells, in contrast, have membrane-bound organelles and a nucleus.\nProkaryotic cells\nProkaryotes are different from eukaryotic cells because of the \nabsence of a nucleus and other membrane-bounded organelles. These \nProkaryotic cells are generally much smaller than eukaryotic cells. Prokaryotic organisms are unicellular.

Like other substances water can \nalso move passively through cell membrane. It moves from a region of high concentration of water molecules (lower solute concentration) to a region of lower concentration of water molecules (higher solute concentration).\nThe movement of water is affected by the concentration of substances \n(solutes) dissolved in the water. Basically, water moves from areas where there is more water to areas where less water is.\nFigure. 3. 15  Osmosis\n1. Before osmosis: two solutions are separated partially permeable membrane. B has a higher solute concentration than A. The soluble molecules are too large to pass through the pores in the membrane but the water molecules are small enough.\n2. As the arrows in diagram A indicate, more water molecules moved from A to B than from B to A, so the net movement has been from A to B, raising the level of the solution in B and lowering in A..\n \nThe movement of water into and out of the cell depends on the type of solution found in the cell surrounding (Environment found outside the cell).\nWhen a cell is in a hypertonic solution, water moves out of the cell, \ncausing the cell to shrink or plasmolysed. In an isotonic solution, water diffuses into and out of the cell at the same rate, with no change in cell size. In a hypotonic solution, water moves into the cell and pressure are applied to the plasma membrane causing turgidity of the cell. The strong cell wall of plant cells can resist this pressure to keep the cell from rupturing.

If a plant cell is surrounded by water or a solution more dilute than its contents (hypotonic solution), water will pass into the vacuole of the plant. The vacuole will expand and press outwards on the cytoplasm and cell wall. Then, the rigid cell wall expands and exert the pressure back, preventing the cell from taking in too much water and bursting. The plant becomes very turgid, due to the pressure of water pressing outwards on the cell wall.\nTurgor pressure is necessary for plants to retain their upright \nposture and the extended state of their leaves. In contrast, if a plant cell is surrounded by water or a solution less dilute than its contents (hypertonic solution), plant cells lose water and there will no longer be any water pressure pressing outwards against the cell walls, the plasma membrane shrinks pulls away from the cell and the cell get plasmolysed. The plasmolysed cell wilts and eventually dies.\nIn this figure 3.16 A. shows that if the water concentration of the \nsolution surrounding the plant cell is too high, the cell swells and turgid. B. If it is the concentration water in both is the same C. If the solution surrounding the cell is too high, the plant cell plasmolysed.\nFigure 3.17.

The survival of an animal cell, thus, depends on its ability to balance water uptake and loss.\nIn the case of animals particularly vertebrates, the concentration \nof water in the blood is monitored by the brain and adjusted by the kidneys. The regulation of water flow is by keeping the blood concentration within narrow limits, the concentration of the tissue fluid remains more or less constant.\nThe animal cell should be surrounded by fluid or blood plasma which \nhas the same concentration of water as the cell contents; there is no net flow of water into or out of the cells. If not balanced, osmosis can cause a serious problem in the animal cell. For Example, if the surrounding solution has a high concentration of water (hypotonic) than the cells, water will move into the cells by osmosis.\nWater entering the cell will make the cell swell up. Animal cells \nhave no cell wall and the membrane has little strength, water would continue to enter and the cells will eventually burst. This process is called hemolysis of the cell which can occur in red blood cells. Conversely, if the surrounding solution has a low concentration of water (hypertonic) than the cells, water will pass out of the cell by osmosis and the cell will shrink.\nFig. 3.18.

For example, compared with its surroundings, an animal nerve cell has a much higher concentration of potassium ions and a much lower concentration of sodium ions. The plasma membrane helps maintain these differences by pumping sodium out of the cell and potassium into the cell.

Sexual reproduction as a rule \ninvolves two parents, each of which contributes special germ cells (egg or sperm) that in union (fertilization) develop into a new individual. \n4.2 Asexual reproduction\nWhat is common to all types of asexual reproduction?\nAsexual reproduction is the production of individuals without gametes \n(eggs or sperm). It includes a number of distinct processes, all without involving sex or a second parent.  Asexual reproduction appears in bacteria and unicellular eukaryotes and in many invertebrates, fungi and plants. However, asexual reproduction is absent among vertebrates. The basic forms of asexual reproduction are fission (binary and multiple), budding, and fragmentation. For example, a small piece of stem planted in the soil may form roots and grow into a complete plant (Fig.4.1). \nAsexual reproduction has couple of advantages - no mate is needed; \nno gametes are needed; all the good characteristics of the parent are passed on to the offspring; and offspring will grow in the same favourable environment as the parent. Plants that reproduce asexually usually store large amounts of food that allow survival. The disadvantages are there is little variation created, so adaptation to a changing environment (evolution) is unlikely. If the parent has no resistance to a particular disease, none of the offspring will have resistance. Lack of dispersal can lead to competition for nutrients, water and light.  At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\tdefine asexual  reproduction\n\u2022\tdifferentiate the process of asexual reproduction \n\u2022\ttell the advantages and disadvantages of asexual \nreproduction  Objectives Activity 4.2: Concept \nmapping\nNo organism can live \nforever, but part of it lives in \nits offspring.

Binary fission is common among bacteria, algae and protozoa. In binary fission, the body of the unicellular parent divides by mitosis into two approximately equal parts, each of which grows into an individual similar to the parent. In bacteria, the cell simply divides into two and each new cell becomes an independent organism (Fig.4.2). However, before a bacterium divides, the bacterial nucleus is replicated (copied) to produce two identical copies so that the daughter cells receive one copy each. Alternatively, the nucleus of the orgasms divide repeatedly and each daughter nucleus breaks away together with a small portion of the cytoplasm, resulting in the production of many daughter cells. This is common among some parasitic protozoa, for example, malarial parasites. Also, some invertebrates reproduce through fission.\nFigure 4.2. Binary fission in bacteria\n4.3.2 Fragmentation\nWhat is fragmentation?\nFragmentation is one of the most common modes of asexual \nreproduction involving the breakdown of a parent organism into parts that develop into whole organism.  Fragmentation is observed in fungi, plants, animals and algae. For Example, Spirogyra, the filamentous green-algae undergoes fragmentation which results in many filaments. Each filament grows into matured filament (Fig.4.3).  At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\tdescribe the process of asexual reproduction in bacteria, \nprotists, fungi, animals  and plants\n\u2022\texplain the mechanism of fission\n\u2022\tdiscuss the mechanism of fragmentation\n\u2022\tdescribe the mechanism of budding\n\u2022\tinvestigate  the mechanism of vegetative propagation\n\u2022\tdescribe the mechanism of parthenogenesis Objectives\nThe cells of some species, \nsuch as bacteria, can divide \nevery 20-30  minutes. \nWhen placed on a solid \ngrowth medium in a petri dish, a bacterial cell and its daughter cells undergo repeated cellular divisions and form a group of genetically identical cells called a bacterial colony. Such rapid rate of bacterial cell reproduction is one reason why a small number of bacteria can seriously contaminate our food products.Attention\n76\nGrade 9 Biology "

Many invertebrates can reproduce asexually by simply breaking into two parts and then regenerating the missing parts of the fragments.\nFigure4.3. Fragmentation in filamentous green-algae\n4.3.3 Budding\nIn budding, the two daughter cells are unequal. Why?\nAnother common type of asexual reproduction is budding. In this \nmode of reproduction, the organism divides into two unequal parts. It is common in fungal species and invertebrates. During the process, a bulge forms on the side of the cell, the nucleus divides mitotically, and the bud ultimately detaches itself from the mother cell. For example, in some fungi such as yeasts, a bud develops on the surface of either the yeast cell or the hypha, with the cytoplasm of the bud being continuous with that of the parent cell. The nucleus of the parent cell then divides; one of the daughter nuclei migrates into the bud, and the other remains in the parent cell (Fig.4.4.). Budding also occurs commonly in some invertebrate animals such as hydra. \n     Figure 4.4.

Spores are dispersed often by air currents and if they reach a suitable situation, they grow new hyphae. The hyphae develop into a mycelium (Fig. 4.5;  left). At the tip of the hyphae, a swelling or sporangium \u2013 spore sac forms.

Runners originate from auxiliary bud in a lower portion of plant \nand grow along the surface of the soil. In the cultivated strawberry, for example, leaves, flowers, and roots are produced at every other node on the runner. Just beyond each second node, the tip of the runner turns up and becomes thickened. This thickened portion produces first adventitious roots and then a new shoot that continues the runner. Thus a complete plant may develop and take root at the node, nourished for a time by food sent from the parent plant through the stolon. Eventually, the stolon dries up and withers, leaving an independent daughter plant growing a short distance away from the parent. \nChromosome: the \nhereditary material that \ncarry the biological information \nHypha  (pl. hyphae): the \nlong filamentous branches \nfound in fungi\nMitosis: type of cell division \nthat produce two identical daughter cells\nMycelium: the vegetative \npart of a fungus, consisting of a network of fine white filaments (hyphae)\nSpore: reproductive cellKey Terms\n78\nGrade 9 Biology "

Such underground horizontal stems are called rhizomes. At the nodes of the rhizome are buds, which may develop to produce shoots above the ground. The shoots become independent plants when the connecting rhizome dies. Many grasses propagate by rhizomes; the couch grass (Fig. 4.6) is a good example.  \nFigure 4.6.

Nearly all of these eggs are fertilized by sperm the queen has received during one of her nuptial fights, and each one of these eggs will develop into one of the worker bees of the colony every one of them a female. A queen can, however, choose to let some of her eggs go unfertilized; no sperm from a male ever fuses with these eggs, yet bees develop within them and hatch from them. Since egg and sperm do not come together in this process, this is not sexual reproduction. Instead, each of these bees has been derived through parthenogenesis: a form of asexual reproduction in which an unfertilized egg develops into an adult organism. Among the honeybees, all the bees derived through parthenogenesis are males these are the few drones of a bee colony.\n4.4 Sexual reproduction in Humans \nWhat is sexual reproduction? \nSexual reproduction involves the production of sex cells. It almost \nalways involves two parent organisms. These sex cells are called gametes and they are made in reproductive organs. The gametes are produced through meiosis. Sexual reproduction starts with the union of sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either inside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization) the body of the female. Fertilization results in the formation of a single cell called a zygote. The zygote then grows into a new individual. The female gametes are always larger than the male gametes and are not mobile.

These are the primary sexual characteristics in males and females, respectively. At puberty or adolescence these characteristics change markedly. \nWhat are secondary sexual characteristics?\nPuberty begins in the early teen years. Puberty or adolescence \nis the time when secondary sex characteristics begin to develop. Secondary sexual characteristics begin to develop so that sexual maturity is reached. Sexual maturity means that the potential for sexual reproduction exists. Secondary sexual characteristics in males include: \n\uf0a7\tgrowth and maintenance of the male sex organs, \n\uf0a7\tan increase in body hair, an increase in muscle mass, \n\uf0a7\tincreased growth of the long bones of the arms and legs, and \n\uf0a7\tdeepening of the voice.\nWhat role do hormones play in puberty?\nThe glands of the endocrine system release hormones (chemical \nsubstances) which control the development and activity of the male reproductive system. The changes that occur during puberty are controlled by sex hormones. These hormones are secreted by the endocrine system. The onset of puberty in males causes the hypothalamus to produce several kinds of hormones. These hormones interact with the pituitary gland. \nPuberty in females begins in the early teen years. In females, LH \ncauses eggs to be released into the oviduct whereas FSH stimulates the development of follicles in the ovary. A follicle is a group of epithelial cells. These epithelial cells surround a developing egg cell. FSH also causes a hormone called estrogen to be released from the ovary. It is responsible for the secondary sex characteristics of females. Secondary sexual characteristics in females include: \n\u2022 Increase in growth rates of the long bones of the arms and legs. Hormones: Are chemical \nmessengers secreted by \nendocrine glands.\nPuberty : the time \nwhen secondary sex \ncharacteristics begin to develop; as secondary sexual characteristics begin to develop, so does sexual maturity, the potential for sexual reproduction. \nSecondary sex characters: \ncharacteristics that are not primarily involved in formation and delivery of egg/sperm, but that are essential for behavioral and functional success of reproduction.

How do they affect life of the youth? \nYoung people must adjust to remarkable physiological, anatomical, \nand psychological transformations during the process of puberty. Their bodies change rapidly, and thus their body image also changes. Any deviations of their bodies from what they or their peers consider \u201cnormal\u201d can lead to low self-esteem. For example, females will worry about the size of their breasts and other aspects of their figures and will not feel feminine if these are not in line with the norm of their peers. Similarly, a male may worry about the size of his penis or his physique; and if these are not within the norm, he will feel that something is wrong with him. Young people should realize that there is considerable variation in the timing of the stages of puberty among different individuals, and that most people develop into \u201cnormal\u201d adults in the course of their sexual and physical maturation.\nAn individual who reaches puberty later or earlier than his or her peers \ncan suffer psychological pain. If not handled in a constructive fashion, early or late puberty can lead to poor self-esteem and problems in sexual and other areas of life. For example, late-developing males may suffer from a poor self-image, and this can influence them in later life. They tend to have a lower occupational attainment, get paid less, marry later, and have fewer children than other men of the same adult height. Early maturing males, on the other hand, can have an easier time of it. They tend to be held in higher esteem by their peers because of their broad shoulders and masculine physiques. Early-maturing females suffer more than early-maturing males. Because of their mature bodies (large breasts), their peers make the assumption that they are sexually experienced and sexually \u201ceasy, \u201d whereas in actuality, early maturing females tend to be submissive, socially indifferent, and low in popularity. Therefore, such individual should get medical or psychological advice to cope up with problems related early or late puberty. \nAdolescence is the period between puberty and adulthood, when a \ngood deal of social learning takes place. The length of this period of youth is socially determined. Its length could be influenced by nature, culture, and civilization. Biologically, teenagers are adult after they have reached puberty, when they are capable of having children. The hypothalamus secretes \na hormone that causes the \npituitary gland to release two other hormones. The hormones are follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). When FSH and LH are released into the bloodstream, are carried to the testes. In the testes, FSH causes the production of sperm cells. LH causes the endocrine cells that are in the testes to produce the male hormone testosterone. Testosterone influences the production of sperm cells. Testosterone is responsible for the growth and development of secondary sex characteristics in the male. The FSH and LH are also secreted in females and influence the development of secondary sex characteristics.Attention\n83\nGrade 9 Biology "

Morally, they are adult when they are responsible for their actions, can express love in a mature manner, and can have productive and meaningful relationships. During adolescence, teenagers must achieve economic and moral adulthood; deal with separation from family.\n4. 6 Male reproductive structures\nWhat are the functions of the male reproductive organs?\nThe male reproductive system of vertebrates, such as human males \n, includes testes, epididymis, vas deferens, accessory glands, and a penis. Paired testes are the sites of sperm production. Each testis is composed of numerous seminiferous tubules, in which the sperm develop. The sperm are surrounded by cells, which nourish the developing sperm. Between the tubules are cells which produce the male sex hormone (testosterone). In most mammals, the two testes are housed permanently in a sac-like scrotum suspended outside the abdominal cavity. This odd arrangement provides an environment of slightly lower temperature, since in most mammals (including humans) viable sperm do not form at temperatures maintained within the body.\nThe sperm travels from the seminiferous tubules to epididymis, where \nsperm maturation occurs and then to a vas deferens, the ejaculatory duct. The vas deferens joins the urethra, a duct that carries both sperm and urinary products through the penis. Three sets of accessory glands open in to the reproductive channels: a pair of seminal vesicles, a single prostate gland, and the pair of bulbourethral glands (Fig.4.8). Fluid secreted by these glands furnishes food to the sperm, lubricates the female reproductive tract for sperm, and counteracts the acidity of the vagina so that the sperm retain their viability longer after being deposited in the female. Semen is a mix of sperm, proteins, nutrients, ions, and signalling molecules. Sperm constitute less than 5 percent of semen volume.

Female reproductive structures\n At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\tIdentify female reproductive structures and their functions. Objectives\nWhat are the functions of female reproductive organs?\nA human female\u2019s gonads\u2014her ovaries\u2014lie deep inside her pelvic \ncavity. They produce and release egg. They also secrete estrogens and progesterone, the main sex hormones in females. Estrogens trigger development of female secondary sexual characteristics and maintain the lining of there productive tract. Progesterone thickens the lining of the reproductive tract in preparation for pregnancy.\nAdjacent to each ovary is an oviduct, a hollow tube that connects the \novary to the uterus. Both oviducts open onto the uterus, a hollow, pear shaped organ. The uterine lining consists of glandular epithelium, connective tissues, and blood vessels. The bottom of the uterus, a narrowed region called the cervix, opens into the vagina. The vagina, which extends from the cervix to the body\u2019s surface, is the organ of intercourse and the birth canal.\nExternally visible organs of the reproductive tract are called genitals. \nFemale genitals include two pairs of liplike skin folds that enclose the openings of the vagina and urethra. Adipose tissue fills the thick outer folds, the labia majora. Thin inner folds are the labia minora. The clitoris lies near the anterior junction of the labia minora. It contains erectile tissue and is highly sensitive to tactile stimulation. The opening into the vagina is often reduced in size in the virgin state by a membrane, the hymen, although in today\u2019s more physically active females, this membrane may be much reduced in extent (Fig.4.10).\nThe paired ovaries of the human female, contain many thousands of \neggs. During a woman\u2019s fertile years, except following fertilization, approximately 13 eggs mature each year, and usually the ovaries alternate in releasing eggs. Because a woman is fertile for only about 30 to 35 years, of the approximately 400,000 eggs in her ovaries at birth, only 300 to 400 have a chance to reach maturity; the others degenerate.\nThe uterine tubes or oviducts are lined with cilia for propelling the egg \naway from the ovary from which it was released. The two ducts open into the upper corners of the uterus, or womb, which is specialized for housing the embryo during its intrauterine existence. It consists of thick muscular walls, many blood vessels, and a specialized lining: the endometrium. The uterus is designed to hold more than one developing embryo. Activity 4.9.

A girl is born with about 2 million eggs. At puberty hormonal changes prompt eggs to mature, one at a time, in an approximately twenty eight- day ovarian cycle. As the cycle begins, the follicle enlarges and a fluid filled cavity forms around it. About two weeks after the follicle began to mature, its wall ruptures and ovulation occurs. The egg and surrounding follicle cells are ejected into the adjacent oviduct. After ovulation, cells of the ruptured follicle develop into a hormone-secreting corpus luteum. If pregnancy does not occur, the corpus luteum breaks down, and a new follicle will begin to mature (Fig.4.11).\nFigure 4.11 Ovulation  1. How are eggs produced?\n2.

We refer to the approximately monthly changes in the uterus as the menstrual cycle. The first day of the menstrual cycle is marked by onset of menstruation (flow \nPhase), which is the flow of bits of uterine lining and some blood from the uterus, through the cervix, and out of the vagina.\nFSH stimulates maturation of an ovarian follicle. The interval of \nfollicle maturation before ovulation is the follicular phase of the cycle. \nDuring this time, cells around the egg secrete estrogens that stimulate the endometrium to thicken. The rise in estrogens encourages the pituitary to release more LH. The flow of LH causes the follicle to swell and burst. LH trigger for ovulation. The luteal phase of the cycle \nbegins after ovulation. LH stimulates formation of the corpus luteum, which secretes some estrogens and a lot of progesterone. These hormones cause the uterine lining to thicken and encourage blood vessels to grow through it. The uterus is now ready for pregnancy (Fig.4.12).\nA woman enters menopause when all the follicles in her ovaries have \neither been released during menstrual cycles or have disintegrated as a result of aging.

That is, the penis becomes firm and erects as a result of blood flowing into the erectile tissue. Arousal in the female stimulates the lining of the vagina to produce mucus. This lubricates the vagina and makes it easy for the erect penis to enter. In the act of copulation, the male inserts the penis into the female\u2019s vagina. The sensory stimulus in the male, which results in the ejaculation of semen into the top of the vagina.\nWhat is fertilization? \nThe sperm swims through the cervix and into the uterus by wriggling \nmovements of their tails. They pass through the uterus and enter the oviduct. If there is an ovum in the oviduct, one of the sperm may bump into it and stick to its surface. The sperm then enters the cytoplasm of the egg and the male nucleus of the sperm fuses with the female nucleus. This is the moment of fertilization (Fig.4.13). The released egg is thought to survive for about 24 hours; the sperm might be able to fertilize an ovum for about 2 or 3 days. So there is only a short period of about 4 days each month when fertilization might occur. If this fertile period can be estimated accurately, it can be used either to achieve or to avoid fertilization (conception).\nTwins (Multiple births) \nHow are twins formed?\nMany mammals give birth to more than one offspring at a time, each \nmember of which has come from a separate egg. There are some mammals, however, that have only one offspring at a time, although occasionally they may have more than one. \nHuman twins may come from one zygote (identical, or monozygotic \ntwins) or two zygotes (non-identical, dizygotic, or fraternal twins). Fraternal twins do not resemble each other any more than other children born separately in the same family, but identical twins are, of course, strikingly alike and always of the same sex. Triplets, quadruplets, and quintuplets may include a pair of identical twins. The other babies in such multiple births usually come from separate zygotes. About 33% of identical twins have separate placentas, but the other identical twins share a common placenta. \n Figure 4.13.

Each of these \ndivides again, so producing four cells. The cells continue to divide in this way to produce a solid ball of cells (Fig. 4.14), an early stage in the development of the embryo. This early embryo travels down the oviduct to the uterus. Here it sinks into the lining of the uterus, a process called implantation. The embryo continues to grow and produces new cells that form tissues and organs. After 8 weeks, when all the organs are formed, the embryo is called a fetus. One of the first organs to form is the heart, which pumps blood around the body of the embryo. Inside the uterus the embryo becomes enclosed in a fluid-filled sac called the amnion or water sac, which protects it from damage and prevents unequal pressures from acting on it. The fluid is called amniotic fluid. \nFigure 4.14   Human embryo developmental stages until week eight \nThe oxygen and food needed to keep the embryo alive and growing are obtained from the mother\u2019s blood by means of a structure called the placenta.

At the moment, however, there is no simple, reliable way to recognize ovulation, though it is usually 12\u201316 days before the onset of the next menstrual period. By keeping careful records of the intervals between menstrual periods, it is possible to calculate a potentially fertile period of about 10 days in mid-cycle, when sexual intercourse should be avoided if children are not wanted.

During or soon after ovulation, a woman\u2019s temperature rises by about 0.5 \u00b0C. It is reasonable to assume that 1 day after the temperature returns to normal, a woman will be infertile. There is 25% chance of pregnancy per year. \n\u2022 Cervical mucus\nAnother clue comes from the type of mucus secreted by the cervix and lining of the vagina. As the time for ovulation approaches, the mucus becomes more fluid. Women can learn to detect these changes and so calculate their fertile period. By combining the \u2018calendar\u2019 , \u2018temperature\u2019 and \u2018mucus\u2019 methods, it is possible to achieve about 80% \u2018success\u2019 , i.e. only 20% unplanned pregnancies. \nNatural methods have no side effects and this method is permitted \nby most religions. Carried out with care and scientific precision about recording techniques it can be very effective. Depends on full co-operation of both partners and it is not always easy to pinpoint ovulation so pregnancy can result. There is a chance of 10 pregnancies per 100 women per year.\n4.10.2  Artificial methods of family planning (barrier methods)\nFemale Condom \nThe female condom is a polyurethane sheath - one end is inserted into \nthe vagina while the other remains outside of the vagina and provides some protection to the external genitalia. It contains a silicone lubricant. Additional lubricant is provided with each condom.\nEffectiveness:  Female condom effectiveness is ninety five percent \n(95%) with perfect use, and eighty percent (80%) with typical use. \nAdvantages: Dual protection against pregnancy, and STI/HIV, \naccessible without prescription, causes few medical side effects, some people find female condoms to be more comfortable and less constricting than male condoms, as they are wider. \nDisadvantages: Coitus dependent, more expensive than male condoms, \nchallenge to use in relationships with weak partner cooperation and/or intimate partner violence\nMale Condom \nMale condoms are available in latex, lambskin, and polyurethane. All three materials effectively prevent pregnancy. Lambskin contains small pores that may permit the passage of bacteria and viruses. Thus they are not recommended for infection prevention.\nEffectiveness: Male condom effectiveness is ninety eight percent \n(98%) with perfect use, and eighty five (85%) with typical use. Activity 4.14: Survey/ \nInterviewing/ role play \nMake Internet search \nor ask a midwife nurse \n(Gynecologist) in your village (school clinic) about artificial methods of family planning methods. Alternatively, you could assign one of your classmate to act as midwife nurse (Gynecologist) and ask her/him about methods of use; advantages and disadvantages; degree of effectiveness of different birth control methods. \n94\nGrade 9 Biology "

Condoms and diaphragms, used in conjunction with chemicals that immobilize sperm, are about 95% effective. However, a diaphragm does not prevent the risk of transmission of STIs (Fig. 4.16).  There are no side effects, offers some protection against cervical cancer. It must be initially fitted by a doctor. May be incorrectly positioned or damaged and allow sperm past. Gives better protection against pregnancy when combined with spermicide. There is a chance of 2.5 pregnancies per 100 woman years.\nSpermicides\nSpermicides are chemicals which, though harmless to the tissues, can kill or immobilize sperm. The spermicide, in the form of a cream, gel or foam, is placed in the vagina. On their own, spermicides are not very reliable but, in conjunction with condoms or diaphragms, they are effective.\nIntra-uterine device (IUD)\nA small T-shaped plastic and copper device, also known as a coil, can be inserted by a doctor or nurse into the wall of the uterus, where it probably prevents implantation of a fertilized ovum. It is about 98% effective but there is a small risk of developing uterine infections, and it does not protect against STIs. Once inserted, no further steps need to be taken. It is relatively effective at preventing implantation and pregnancy. It can cause pain and heavy periods; can cause uterine infections which may lead to infertility. If pregnancy does occur, it has a high chance of being in the Fallopian tubes (ectopic pregnancy). There is a chance 2.5 pregnancy per 100 woman years\nIntra-uterine system (IUS)\nThis is similar to an IUD; is T-shaped and releases the hormone progesterone slowly over a long period of time (up to 5 years). The hormone prevents ovulation. An IUS does not protect against STIs.\nContraceptive pill\nThe pill contains chemicals, which have the same effect on the body \n95\nGrade 9 Biology "

They are 99% effective, but long-term use of some types may increase the risk of cancer of the breast and cervix. The pill does not protect against STIs.\nContraceptive implant\nThis is a small plastic tube of about 4 cm long which is inserted under the skin of the upper arm of a woman by a doctor or nurse. Once in place, it slowly releases the hormone progesterone, preventing pregnancy. It lasts for about 3 years. It does not protect against STIs, but has more than a 99% success rate in preventing pregnancy.\nContraceptive injection\nThis injection, given to women, contains progesterone and stays effective for between 8 and 12 weeks. It works by thickening the mucus in the cervix, stopping sperm reaching an egg. It also thins the lining of the uterus, making it unsuitable for implantation of an embryo. It does not protect against STIs.\nSurgical methods\nMale sterilization \u2013 vasectomy\nThis is a simple and safe surgical operation in which the man\u2019s sperm \nducts are cut and the ends sealed. This means that his semen contains the secretions of the prostate gland and seminal vesicle but no sperm so cannot fertilize an ovum. Sexual desire, erection, copulation and ejaculation are quite unaffected. The testis continues to produce sperm and testosterone. The sperm are removed by white cells as fast as they form. The testosterone ensures that there is no loss of masculinity. The sperm ducts can be rejoined by surgery but this is not always successful.\nFemale sterilization\u2013 laparotomy\nA woman may be sterilized by an operation in which her oviducts are \ntied, blocked or cut. The ovaries are unaffected. Sexual desire and menstruation continue as before, but sperm can no longer reach the ova. Ova are released, but break down in the upper part of the ovi-duct.

Trichomoniasis, syphilis, gonorrhea, chaceriod and \nHIV/AIDS  are the common STIs in Ethiopia. \nTrichomoniasis\nIt is caused by the flagellated protozoan Trichomonas vaginalis. Many \ninfected people do not have symptoms, but some infected women have a yellowish discharge, and a sore, itchy vagina. In both sexes, an untreated infection can cause infertility. Some epidemiological studies suggest that, in men, untreated trichomoniasis may increase the risk of benign prostate enlargement and aggressive prostate cancer. A single dose of an antiprotozoal drug can quickly cure the infection. Both partners should be treated\n.\nChlamydia\nIt is caused by Chlamydia trachomatis. Chlamydias are small bacteria.  \nIn women, an infection of the reproductive tract by bacteria most often goes undetected. Some women and most men experience painful urination; most infected men have a clear or yellow discharge from the penis. Left untreated, a Chlamydia infection can scar the reproductive tract and lead to infertility in both sexes. An infection can be passed from a mother to child during birth, causing pneumonia and conjunctivitis in the newborn. Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics.\nGonorrhea\nIs the second most common bacterial STI is caused by Neisseria \ngonorrhoeae. Men usually develop symptoms within one week of becoming infected; yellow pus oozes from the penis and urination becomes frequent and painful. By contrast, most women have no early symptoms. In both sexes an infection can damage reproductive ducts and cause sterility. Gonorrhea is treated with antibiotics, but strains resistant to the most widely used antibiotics are increasingly common. Gonorrhea could harms the joints and skin, but can also affect the heart and liver. \nSyphilis\nIs caused by Treponema pallidum, a spiral shaped bacterium. During \nsex with an infected partner, these bacteria get onto the genitals or into the cervix, vagina, or oral cavity. They slip into the body through tiny cuts. If untreated, the infection can become systemic. Skin chancres \nappear and the liver, bones, and eventually the brain can be damaged.

HIV leads to Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS. Once attached, the virus can penetrate the immune cell. The virus may remain inactive for months. \nSpread of HIV\nThe disease HIV is spread from an infected person through blood \nor body fluids. This can occur through direct contact with the infected blood or body fluids. It also can occur through contact with objects that have been contaminated by infected blood or body fluids. Intimate sexual contact and use of contaminated intravenous needles are known methods of disease transmission. HIV also can be transmitted by blood transfusion if the blood is contaminated. A pregnant woman who has HIV can transmit it to her fetus. The virus also can be transmitted through breast milk.\nWhat are the symptoms of AIDS?The first symptoms of AIDS may not appear for as many as ten years \nafter a person is infected. During this time, the AIDS virus reproduces, infecting more and more immune cells. People infected with HIV may develop AIDS. Early symptoms of AIDS may include swollen lymph nodes, loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, rashes, night sweats, and fatigue. It is not known how many people who are infected with HIV will develop AIDS. AIDS weakens the body\u2019s immune system and the body cannot fight off other infectious diseases or certain forms of cancer.\nPrevention and control of HIV\nAbstinence from intimate sexual contact protects against HIV \nand other sexually transmitted diseases. HIV transmission can be prevented among users of illegal drugs if they do not share needles. When AIDS first appeared, there were no effective drugs. Today, there is a range of drugs that can be given separately or as a \u2018cocktail\u2019 , which slow the progress of the disease. Research to find a vaccine and more effective drugs is ongoing. There is a range of blood tests designed to detect HIV infection. These tests do not detect the virus but do indicate whether antibodies to the virus are in the blood. If HIV antibodies are present, the person is said to be HIV positive. The tests vary in their reliability and some are too expensive for widespread use.\nControl of the spread of STIs\nThe best way to avoid sexually transmitted infections is to avoid \nhaving sexual intercourse with an infected person. However, the symptoms of the disease are often not obvious and it is difficult to recognize an infected individual. So the STI is avoided by not having Activity 4.16: Peer \nconferencing\nAIDS: Acquired Immune \nDeficiency Syndrome. The \nvirus that causes AIDS is the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

The ability of organisms to repro-\nduce to form their own kind is the one characteristic that best distinguishes living things from nonliving matter.\n\uf0a7\tAsexual reproduction is the process resulting in the production of genetically identical off-spring from one parent. It occurs without gametes or fertilization.\n\uf0a7\tThe basic forms of asexual reproduction are fission (binary and multiple), budding, and fragmentation. \n\uf0a7\tMany flowering plants reproduce asexually by vegetative propagation. The stolon of the strawberry plant is a horizontal stem that grows above the ground, takes root at the nodes and produces new plants. Rhizomes, corms, bulbs and tap root may store food, which is used to accelerate early growth.\n\uf0a7\tSexual reproduction is the process involving the fusion of the nuclei of two gametes to form a zygote and the production of offspring that are different from each other. The male gamete is small and mobile. The female gamete is larger and not often mobile. The female gamete of an animal is an egg. \n\uf0a7\tFertilization is the fusion of gamete nuclei. Fertilization happens when a sperm enters an ovum and the sperm and egg nuclei join up (fuse).The fertilized egg (zygote) divides into many cells and becomes embedded in the lining of the uterus. Here it grows into an em-bryo.\n\uf0a7\tThe human males are born with the penis, scrotum and testicle whereas females are born with vagina, uterus, and ovaries. These are the primary sexual characteristics in males and females, respectively. \n\uf0a7\tSecondary sexual characteristics in males include: growth and maintenance of the male sex organs, an increase in body hair, an increase in muscle mass, increased growth of the long bones of the arms and legs, and  deepening of the voice.\n\uf0a7\tSecondary sexual characteristics in females include: increase in growth rates of the long bones of the arms and legs, develop more hair, especially under the arms and in the pubic area, the hips broaden, and more fat is deposited in the breasts, buttocks, and thighs, the menstrual cycle begins.\n\uf0a7\tYoung people must adjust to remarkable physiological, anatomical, and psychological transformations during the process of puberty.\n\uf0a7\tYoung people should realize that there is considerable variation in the timing of the stages of puberty among different individuals, and that most people develop into \u201cnormal\u201d adults in the course of their sexual and physical maturation.\n\uf0a7\tAdolescence is the period between puberty and adulthood, when a good deal of social learning takes place.\n\uf0a7\tBiologically, teenagers are adult after they have reached puberty, when they are capable of having children.\n\uf0a7\tEconomically, they are adult when they can support themselves and possibly a family.\n\uf0a7\t Morally, they are adult when they are responsible for their actions, can express love in a mature manner, and can have productive and meaningful relationships.

Semen is expelled from the body through the urethra that runs through the penis\n.\n\uf0a7\tHuman ovaries produce eggs and sex hormones. An oviduct conveys an egg to the uterus. The cervix of the uterus opens into the vagina, which serves as the organ of intercourse and the birth canal. \n\uf0a7\tPituitary release follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). \n\uf0a7\tFSH causes an ovarian follicle to begin maturing.

Nutrients\n At the end of this section, the student will be able to:\n\u2022\tlist important nutrients\n\u2022\texplain about the importance nutrients and their deficiency Objectives\nNutrients: are important chemical substances that are found in foods. \nIn human body, we need nutrients for growth, source of energy and stay healthy. We obtain these nutrients from the foods we eat. The five important classes of nutrients are: carbohydrates, proteins, lipids (Fats and oil),vitamins, minerals  and water.\nMacronutrients and Micronutrients\nThe three nutrients, carbohydrate, protein and fats are required in \nlarge quantities. Such nutrients are called macronutrients. In contrast, minerals and vitamins are needed in very small quantities and are called micronutrients.\nVitamins and minerals do not supply energy but they play an important \nrole in the regulation of the metabolic activity in the body and help in the utilization of proteins, fats and carbohydrates. Minerals are also used for the formation of body structure and skeleton.Activity 5.2: Group work\nI. What is difference between \nnutrition and nutrients?\nII.

            "text": "Unit 5: Human Health, Nutrition, and DiseaseCarbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are types of nutrients that provide energy for the human body. They are composed of three elements, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. The human body gets carbohydrate from green plants. These green plants prepare carbohydrate in the form of starch by the process of Photosynthesis. They combine carbon dioxide and water using energy from the sun in order to produce carbohydrate. Such carbohydrates are the major sources of energy in our diet. Starch is abundant in potatoes, bread, maize, rice and other cereals. Sugar appears in our diet mainly as sucrose (table sugar) and is added to \ndrinks and many prepared foods such as biscuits and cakes. Sugars also occur naturally in many fruits and some vegetables. One gram of carbohydrate can provide, on average, 16 kilojoules (kJ) of energy.\nAn unavailable or indigestible carbohydrate provides dietary fiber \nthat does not serve as a source of energy. This indigestible part is a product of plant\u2019s cell walls that consists mainly of cellulose. Human body does not have any enzymes for the digestion of this cellulose. Therefore, the plant cell walls reach the large intestine (colon) without being digested. This undigested part of the diet is called fiber or roughage. The colon contains many bacteria that can digest some of the substances in the plant cell walls to form fatty acids.\nThe fibre and the bacteria, which multiply from feeding on it, add bulk \nto the contents of the colon and help it to recollect water. This softens the feces and reduces the time needed for the undigested residues to pass out of the body. Both effects help to prevent constipation and keep the colon healthy and increase bowel movement. It is found in \nvegetables, fruits, and grains.\nThere are three types of carbohydrates\n\u2022 Monosaccharide The simplest carbohydrate is simple sugar or \nmonosaccharide which include glucose, fructose and galactose. These three monosaccharide each have six carbon atoms, so they are also known as hexose sugars. Their molecular formula is C\n6H12O6.\n\u2022 Disaccharide: Similar to other carbohydrates, disaccharides are comprised of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen.  It is the combination of two simple sugars to form a complex sugar called disaccharide. These are maltose (Glucose + Glucose), sucrose (Glucose + Fructose and lactose (Glucose + Galactose). The general chemical formula of disaccharides is C\n12H22O11.\n\u2022 Polysaccharide, which is formed when many simple sugar join together. They are substances whose molecules contain hundreds or thousands of monosaccharaides linked together into long chains. polysaccharides are found in plant cell as cellulose and The energy produced from \nthe raw materials is usually \nmeasured in units known as calories; one calorie is the amount of energy needed to raise the temperature of 1 g or cubic centimeter (cc) of water in 1\u00b0C. The calorie units usually referred to in biology and nutrition are kilogram-calories (Kcal); each is 1,000 gram-calories.Attention\n107\nGrade 9 Biology "

Like carbohydrates, fats and oils are composed of three elements, carbon, oxygen and hydrogen. Fats are obtained from animal source and are solid at room temperature while oils are from plant source and liquid at room temperature. The major sources of fat are meat, milk, cheese, butter and egg-yolk. We obtain oils from fruits, seeds (e.g. sunflower seed). In human body, lipid is used to make fatty tissue, adipose tissue, \nunder the skin forms a layer that can reduce heat losses from the body. Besides satisfying metabolic energy needs, dietary fat, also serve as a vehicle for the absorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E and K).\nProteins\nProteins are nutrients, which provide growth of the body and build a \nnew cell. It is made up of amino acid composed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen. In all living things, the structural part of the cell is composed of protein.\nThe major sources of dietary proteins from animals are meat, fish, \neggs, milk and cheese.

They are organic substances needed for chemical reactions of human cells. Plants can make these vitamins in their leaves, but animals as well as human have to obtain many of them ready-made either from plants or from other animals. If any one of the vitamins is missing or deficient in the diet, the vitamin- deficiency disease may develop. Examples of vitamins: are vitamin A, vitamin E, \nthiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2), and vitamin C.\nMineralsMinerals are inorganic substances, which are essential in small \nquantities for human body. The major minerals, which are necessary for human body, are Calcium, Iron, phosphorous and Iron. \nCalcium is used to build teeth and bones, it make muscles to contract \nand help for the transmission of nerve impulses. The important sources of calcium are milk, cheese etc.\nIron is a mineral which synthesizes the hemoglobin of red \nblood cells. Hemoglobin is a molecule, which carries oxygen in \nblood.

The causes of malnutrition can be poverty, famine due to drought or flood, soil erosion, wars, too little land for too many people, ignorance of proper nutritional requirements.\nThe dual burden of malnutrition consists of both under nutrition and \noverweight and obesity, as well as diet-related non communicable diseases. Malnutrition causes tissue damage, growth retardation, disorderly differentiation, reduce developing of children\u2019s brain including negative behavioural issues which can cause poor intellectual capacity, class repetition, reduce productivity.  \nUnder nutrition the most common form of malnutrition is caused by \nunder nutrition of protein and dietary energy (Carbohydrate, lipids). If the total intake of food is not sufficient to meet the body\u2019s need for energy, it leads to loss of weight, muscle wastage, weakness and ultimately starvation. Extreme reduction of diets, such as carbohydrate foods can result in the deficiency disease like marasmus. The victims of malnutrition due to food deficiencies have reduced resistance  to \ndifferent types of diseases. Under nutrition addresses the following \nfour broad groups of conditions :\nWasting (low weight-for-height) is defined as low weight-for-height. \nIt often indicates recent and severe weight loss, although it can also persist for a long time. It usually occurs when a person has not had food of adequate quality and quantity and/or they have had frequent or prolonged illnesses. Wasting in children is associated with a higher risk of death if not treated properly.\nStunting (low height-for-age), is defined as low height for age. It is the \nresult of chronic or recurrent under nutrition, usually associated with poverty, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness and/or inappropriate feeding and care in early life. Stunting prevents children from reaching their physical and cognitive potential.Activity 5.10: Think-pair-\nshare\nDiscuss with your friend \nnext to you and share \nyour idea with the other classmate.\nSometimes a person can eat \na lot of food, can this cause malnutrition?\n115\nGrade 9 Biology "

This stimulates smoker\u2019s to cough which is an effort to \nmove the mucus, the bronchioles and bronchi becomes thicker. This thickening of the bronchioles causes them to narrow and makes it difficult to breathe, this leads to infections such as pneumonia. This damage and obstruction of the airways is chronic bronchitis.\nIn addition, there are different chemical compounds in tar such as \ncarcinogen (produce cancer) compounds. Cancer starts because of the changes in the epithelial cells of the lungs that lead to the development of a mass of cells, known as a tumor. It is this tumor which results in cancer.\nEmphysemaSmokers usually have weakened alveoli wall because of the above \naction of tar that result in coughing. During coughing, some of the weakened alveoli burst. Then the amount of alveoli decrease as well as absorbing surface of the lungs is greatly reduced. Then the smoker cannot oxygenate his or her blood properly and the least exertion makes the person breathless and exhausted. Bronchioles collapse during expiration, trapping air in the alveoli, which often burst. This condition is called emphysema.\nii. Carbon monoxide\nCarbon monoxide is a poisonous gas found in cigarette. During \ncigarette smoking, the carbon monoxide enters to lung. This carbon monoxide diffuses across the walls of the alveoli and diffuses into red blood cells where it combines with haemoglobin to form the compound carboxy- haemoglobin.\nThe carbon monoxide combines permanently with hemoglobin. Then \nno more oxygen is carried by hemoglobin that results in the reduction of the volume of oxygen in blood. Therefore, less oxygen is supplied to the heart. In this case, the heart beat increases to get more oxygen. Carbon monoxide may also damage the lining of the blood vessels. In this case, smokers put the health of their cardiovascular system at risk. The damaging of the walls of arteries may lead to the build-up of fatty tissue and the reduction of blood flow. This may result coronary heart disease (CHD) and stroke. These diseases are a major cause of death and disability in the world.\niii. Nicotine\nNicotine is a compound found in cigarette.

Dopamine is \nthe natural neurotransmitter substance associated with our experience of pleasure. Long-term exposure to nicotine eventually comes to have the reverse effect, actually depressing the ability to experience pleasure. So more nicotine is needed to \u2018satisfy\u2019 , and cigarettes become addictive. Smokers find it increasingly hard to quit the habit.\nNicotine also increases the heart rate and blood pressure. It narrows \nthe arterioles, which increases blood pressure. It decreases the blood flow, particularly in the hands and feet, and it makes blood clotting more likely. It also increases the stickiness of blood platelets that promote blood clotting.\nFigure 5.8 Substances in tobacco smoke\n2. Drinking Alcohol\nAlcohol is a socially acceptable drug in many countries including \nEthiopia. In Ethiopia, there are different types of alcohol drinks such as Tella, Arekie (Katicala), Beer, Wine. When human body consumes alcohol, it is absorbed through the wall of the stomach and small intestine and it is absorbed into the blood. Alcohol gets distributed through- out the body by the help of blood circulation. It is absorbed by liver cells and broken down by liver enzymes, There- fore its concentration in the blood decreases gradually. \nTo decreases  the risk of alcohol-related harms,  the World health \norganization identifies a standard drink as having 10 grams of pure ethanol. It recommended no more than two drinks per day on average for both men and women.\nAlcohol is a depressant. It affects the brain by slowing down the \ntransmission of nerve impulses. Consuming larger quantities of alcohol leads to:The breaking down of \nalcohol by liver enzyme \nhappens more quickly in men than in women because men have more of these enzymes and their enzymes tend to be more active. They also have more water and less fat in their bodies than women do, which tends to cause the concentration of alcohol in the blood to decrease more quickly.Attention\n120\nGrade 9 Biology "

They feel tense and irritable. It is hard to cope with everyday problems without drinking they develop a tolerance as more enzymes that metabolize alcohol are made in the liver. They therefore need to take greater quantities of alcohol to get the same effect. Alcoholics can cause their families pain and unhappiness. They can become aggressive after drinking and spend a lot of money on drink. There are also other social problems such as crime, family disputes, marital breakdown, child neglect and abuse, absenteeism from work, vandalism, assault and violent crime including murder.\nLong-term effects of alcohol\nDrinking large quantities of alcohol over a number of years can lead \nto stomach ulcers, heart disease and brain dam- age. In addition, large amount of alcohol damage the liver tissue and replaced by scar tissue known as cirrhosis. This condition may leads to death unless the person stops drinking.\n3. Heroin\nHeroin is a powerful depressant that slows down the nervous system. \nIt has a chemical structure that is similar to endorphins, a group of chemicals that are found in the brain. Endorphins are made naturally in the brain and provide relief when the body experiences pain or stress.\nEndorphins work on the synapses in the brain and preventing neurons \nfrom transmitting impulses from pain receptors, so they producing pain relief. When a person takes heroin, the heroin molecules bind to the endorphin receptor sites, blocking nerve transmission. This mimics the function of natural endorphins. Therefore, by using heroin, the feeling of pain disappears and addiction produced. People practice to take heroin to reduce the pain. This is how the body develops a tolerance to the drug, and it has to be taken in ever-greater quantities in order to feel euphoria or just to reduce the pain.\n4.

Drugs are broken down in the body by enzymes and the products are excreted. The breakdown products can be detected in the urine, and this is why urine tests are carried out to see if people have been taking drugs. Athletes taking part in competitions and car drivers who have been in accidents are routinely tested for drugs.Attention\n121\nGrade 9 Biology "

Chewing khat\nKhat (Catha edulis) is bushy plant whose leaves are chewed for its \nstimulant effect. This plant is grown in southern Arabia and Eastern Africa including Ethiopia, Somalia, and Kenya. Khat is usually \nsupplied as a bundle of leaves and fresh shoots wrapped in false banana leaves.\nKhat contains a chemical compound known as cathinone, which \naffects central nervous system (CNS). This cathinone can be found only in fresh Khat leaves. Chewing khat releases Cathinone into \nthe saliva that can be absorbed to the body easily. Only fresh leaves are chewed, because cathinone soon degrades into old in dry plant material.\nAlthough khat can be ingested as an infusion or smoked, the most \ncommon route of administration is to chew the fresh plant. The juice of the masticated material is swallowed, while the residues are spat out. In some places, teas from dried leaves are also consumed.\nEthiopia is one of the country where large number of people with the \nhabit of chewing chat. In the previous years, it was mainly cultivated in eastern part of the country. However, currently, it is grown and consumed in all parts of the country.\nThis current increment in khat consumption brings socio-economic, \npsychological and physical health consequence on the individuals involved. Chewing khat induce a state of joy and feelings of increased alertness and stimulation. At the end its consequence results in a depressed mood, irritability, loss of appetite, gastritis and peptic ulcer, disease and difficulty sleeping. In addition, the habit of chewing khat leads to some social problems like family fragment, multiple sexual practices and the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) due to unprotected sex.

Doping\nThe term \u201cdoping\u201d refers to  the use of prohibited medications, drugs, \nor treatments  in competitive sports . It is practiced in athletes with \nthe intention of improving athletic performance.   Performance enhancing drugs (PEDs) is another term used to for drugs used by athletes to improve their athletic performance.  \nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) uses  a battery of blood \nand urine tests  to determine if athletes are cheating. A key tool is the \nbiological passport program, which tests all athletes for doping and performance enhancing drugs.  \nWhy is doping such a big deal? The most important reason doping is a big deal is the fact that many \nof these substances can have harmful and long-lasting side effects which may include :\nCardiovascular: irregular heart rhythm, elevated blood pressure, \nheart attack, sudden death.  \nCentral Nervous System: insomnia, anxiousness, depression, \naggressive behavior, suicide, headache, addiction with withdrawal, \npsychosis, tremor, dizziness, stroke  \nRespiratory: nose bleeds, sinusitis\nHormonal: infertility, gynecomastia (enlarged breasts), decreased \ntesticular size, low sex drive, acromegaly (coarse bones in face, hands, and feet), cancer\nThe second issue is more of a moral dilemma. These banned substances \nare used to gain an unfair advantage which significantly diminishes \nthe spirit of competition.  \nThe World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), has a program which has a purpose,  to protect the athletes\u2019 fundamental right to participate in doping-free sport and thus promote health, fairness and equality for athletes worldwide.\nWhat substances are banned from use?\nSome drugs are banned both in and out of competition due to their \nperformance enhancing properties, while others are only banned during competition. Another reason for banning a drug is due to their ability to mask the presence of a different banned drug during testing.\nIn general, the following classes of drugs are banned:  Street drugs, \nstimulants, anabolic steroids, peptide hormones (i.e. human growth The word doping is probably \nderived from the Dutch \nword dop, the name of an alcoholic beverage made of grape skins used by Zulu warriors in order to enhance their prowess in battle.AttentionActivity 5.18: Group work\nMake a group of four or \nfive students and make a \ndiscussion on:\n1.

Others, such as tuberculosis (TB), human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection may last a much longer time.\nTransmission of infectious diseases\nAn understanding of the biology of the pathogen and its mode of \ntransmission is essential to control and prevent the disease. Different infectious diseases have different mode of transmission.\n\u2022 Some infectious diseases are transmitted from one per- son to another by direct contact with a patient.\n\u2022 Other infectious diseases are transmit by drinking contaminated water or by eating contaminated food, (food or water contains disease-causing organisms like bacteria and virus). This is because the infectious organisms can survive in water, human food, faeces\n\u2022 Some infectious diseases  are transmitted  by insect bite.\n\u2022 Some infectious diseases  are transmitted by sexual inter-course etc.\nPreventing infections and control methods of infectious diseases\nControl is an attempt to break transmission cycles by removing the \nconditions that favour the spread of the disease causing organisms.\n1. Vaccination: is a major control measure for many infectious diseases; it works by making the body to defend against disease causing organisms.\n2. Personal hygiene; people of all ages should wash their hands after using the toilet and before handling or eating food; this protects the entrance of disease causing organisms into our body.\n3. Hygienic food preparation: food should be covered to keep flies away, kitchen surfaces should be cleaned to kill bacteria, and food should be cooked exhaustively to make sure any bacteria are killed.\n4. Boiling cooking and/or drinking water to kill the pathogensEndemic : This disease is \noccurring when disease-\ncausing agent exists permanently in specific place or population, For example malaria is endemic in Afar region.\nEpidemics are diseases that \noccur suddenly and then spread in a specific area or within a specific population group, For example, in 2015 Ebola was epidemic in west Africa.\nPandemic  is an epidemic \nthat spreads far more widely \nthroughout the whole world.

For example, the disease causing organism that cause giardia and cholera are transmitted through contamination of drinking water by faeces and sewage.\nHuman immune deficiency virus infection/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV- AIDS)\nAcquired immunodeficiency syndrome is caused by the human \nimmunodeficiency virus (HIV).HIV infection rates are especially high sub-Saharan Africa including Ethiopia. Peoples who have HIV in their body are called HIV-positive or HIV carriers. Usually, these HIV positive people do not show any symptom of the disease for several years after infection. Infection of HIV starts when the virus infects and enters to T-lymphocytes. These are cells that defend our body from diseases.\nHIV replicates and survives in human T-lymphocyte cells. During its \nreplication HIV, destroys these T-lymphocytes cells. As a result the number of T-lymphocytes gradually decrease which leads to declining of disease resistant mechanism of the body. When the body reduced in its dis- ease resistant mechanism, it causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is the result of opportunistic diseases like pneumonia, TB, cancers; weight loss, diarrhoea etc.\nTransmission  of HIV- AIDS\nHIV can be passed from one person to another by direct exchange of body fluids such as:\n\u2022 Fluid transfer from one person to another during sexual intercourse\n\u2022 Blood transfusion from one person to another, during blood donation\n\u2022 Sharing needles in intravenous drug users\n\u2022 Mother to fetus across placenta, more often, through the mixing of blood during birth\n\u2022 Mother to infant in breast milk\nPrevention and control of HIV-AIDS\nThere are no cure drug for HIV-AIDS and no vaccine for HIV, there-\nfore it is very important to prevent this disease by the following meth-ods.Activity 5.20: Think \u2013 Pair \u2013 \nShare\nDiscuss with your friend \nnext to you and share \nyour idea with the other classmate. \nExplain the difference \nbetween being HIV-positive and having AIDS\n129\nGrade 9 Biology "

These retro-viral drugs can also significantly increase the length of time between a person be-coming infected with HIV and developing symptoms of AIDS and can significantly prolong life.\nTuberculosis  (TB)\nTuberculosis is another example of infectious disease caused by the bacterium called Mycobacterium tuberculosis and rarely by \nMycobacterium bovis. These bacteria live inside human cells, mainly in the lungs. TB has many symptoms like cough, chest pain, shortness of breath, fever, sweating, weight loss etc. After infection, some people develop TB quite quickly, while in others the bacteria remain inactive for many years. This difference is because of the difference in disease resistance ability between peoples.\nTB transmissionTB bacteria can enter the lungs in airborne droplets. It spread when \ninfected people with the active form of the illness cough or sneeze. The bacteria are carried in the air in tiny droplets of liquid. Transmission occurs when people who are uninfected inhale (breath in) the droplets. These happen rapidly in places where many people are living in crowded conditions such as very crowded public transportation.\nThe other transmission way is by consuming undercooked meat and \nunpasteurized milk. This type of transmission mainly occurs for the TB transmits from infected animals.\nPrevention and control of TBThere are drugs and vaccines that are important to treat and prevent \nthis disease\nTreatment of  TB: A person, who shows symptoms relating to TB, \nshould his/her sputum sample tested for the presence of TB bacteria. \nIf a person is positive for TB, then patients should be isolated while they are in the most infectious stage (which is at two to four weeks). The treatment involves using several drugs to ensure that all the bacteria are killed. The treatment also need about six to nine months. If the bacteria not killed by treatment, it may be because of drug resistance TB.T- Lymphocyte cells \n(Immune cells) have another \nname called T-helper cells that defend our body from infection. Opportunistic diseases: disease caused by different disease causing organisms that occurs when the body diseases resistance mechanism.\nRetroviral drugs are drugs \nthat are used to stop or reduce viral replication in human, but they don\u2019t kill the virus.Attention\nDrug resistance bacteria: \nare bacteria that does not \nkilled by commonly used drugs.

This is important to prevent TB transmission from animal to human.\nMalaria\nMalaria is caused by protozoa known as plasmodium Protozoa. \nMalaria is found in many parts of the world where Anopheles mosquito \nspecies that can act as vectors are found. It is very common in tropical and subtropical regions where humidity is high, a comfortable environment for mosquito breeding. Female Anopheles mosquitoes feed on human blood to obtain the protein they need to develop their eggs. If the person they bite is infected with Plasmodium, they will take up some of the plasmodium together the blood meal. When the mosquito feeds again another healthy person, she injects the plasmodium with her saliva. Then the parasites enter the red blood cells, where they multiply.Activity 5.21: Group work\nMake a group, each with four or five students and discuss in group \nabout:\ni.

The reason is simple: your environment affects you and every other organism in it. \nWhat is Ecology?\nThe branch of biology that deals with the study of the interactions \namong organisms and with their environment is known as ecology.  Scientists who study ecology are called ecologists. Because our planet has many diverse plants, animals, and environments, ecologists tend to study smaller areas called ecosystems.

The combination of the job an organism does and the place in which it lives is called its niche. What are some jobs that organisms do? Plants and algae trap the energy in sunlight and produce their own food. Because of this, they are known as producers. Animals are consumers; bacteria and fungi are decomposers. \nEcologists use both qualitative and quantitative research. They \ngather qualitative information by observing organisms and their environment. They gather quantitative data by making measurements and doing experiments. Ecologists study organisms both in the laboratory and in the field where they live. \n6.1.2. Biotic and abiotic components\nAbiotic Factors\nAbiotic factors are non-living components of the ecosystem that \ninfluence the distributions of organisms in their environment. Examples of abiotic factors include: energy, light, temperature, water, nutrients, salinity, etc. \nAll organisms require a usable source of energy  to live. Solar \nenergy from sunlight, captured by chlorophyll during the process of \nphotosynthesis, powers most ecosystems. Lack of sunlight is rarely the most important factor limiting plant growth for terrestrial ecosystems, although shading by trees does create intense competition for light among plants growing on forest floors. In many aquatic environments, however, light cannot penetrate beyond certain depths. As a result, most photosynthesis in a body of water occurs near the surface. Surprisingly, life also thrives in environments that are completely dark. These ecosystems are powered by bacteria that derive energy from the oxidation of inorganic chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide. Bacteria with similar metabolic talents support communities of caved dwelling organisms.1. Describe what animals \nshare your surrounding? \n2.

Few organisms can maintain a sufficiently active metabolism at temperatures close to 0\u00b0C (32\u00b0F), and temperatures above 45\u00b0C (113\u00b0F) destroy the enzymes of most organisms (Fig.6.1). Most organisms function best within a specific range of environmental temperatures. \nWater  is essential to all life. Aquatic organisms are surrounded by \nwater, but they face problems of water balance if their own solute \nconcentration does not match that of their surroundings. For terrestrial organisms, the primary threat is drying out in the air. Many land animals have watertight coverings that reduce water loss, such as reptilian scales. Most plants have waxy coatings on their leaves and other aerial parts. \nThe distribution and abundance of photosynthetic organisms, \nincluding plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria, depend on the availability of inorganic nutrients such as compounds of nitrogen \nand phosphorus. Plants obtain these nutrients from the soil. Soil \nstructure, pH, and nutrient content  often play major roles in \ndetermining the distribution of plants. In many aquatic ecosystems, low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus limit the growth of algae and photosynthetic bacteria. \nSeveral abiotic factors are important in aquatic, but not terrestrial, \necosystems. While terrestrial organisms have a plentiful supply of oxygen from the air, aquatic organisms must depend on oxygen \ndissolved in water. This is a critical factor for many species of fish. Cold, fast-moving water has higher oxygen content than warm or stagnant water. Salinity (saltiness), currents, and tides also play a \nrole in many aquatic ecosystems.\nSome abiotic factors affect terrestrial, but not aquatic, ecosystems. For \nexample, wind is often an important factor on land. Wind increases \nan organism\u2019s rate of water loss by evaporation. The resulting increase in evaporative cooling can be advantageous on a hot summer day, but it can cause dangerous wind chill in the winter. In some ecosystems, frequent occurrences of natural disturbances such as storms or fire play a role in the distribution of organisms.\n141\nGrade 9 Biology "

Herbivores could affect the distribution of a food species.

They study relationships among \norganisms of the same species and connections among organisms \nof different species. They also study the effects of abiotic factors on species that live together. To make it easier to examine all of these biotic and abiotic interactions, ecologists have organized the living world into levels. The levels are the organism by itself, populations, communities, ecosystems and biosphere (Fig.6.3).The traditional ecological investigation usually starts at the level of the individual. \nFigure 6.3 Ecological levels  \nWhat is a population?\nA population is a group of interbreeding organisms that are members \nof the same species living in the same area at the same time. Members of the same population may compete with each other for food, water, mates, or other resources. Some species have adaptations that reduce competition within a population. For instance, frogs have a life cycle in which the young tadpoles and adult frogs look very different and have different diets.

Examples of interactions include predation, parasitism, herbivory, competition, and pollination. In a biological community, changes in one population may cause changes in other populations. For instance, if the number of mouse-eating birds (e.g., hawks) in a community increases slightly, the number of mice in that community will decrease slightly. In a healthy forest community, there are many populations that depend on each other. These might include birds eating insects, mushrooms growing from decaying leaves or bark. While these populations are connected to each other, they are all affected by abiotic factors. These relationships between different populations and their surroundings create an ecosystem.\n6.1.4. Ecosystems \nThe community of organisms in a habitat, plus the non-living part of the environment (e.g., air, water, soil, light, etc.) makes up an ecosystem. A lake is an ecosystem, which consists of the plant and animal communities mentioned above, and the water, minerals, dissolved oxygen, soil and sunlight on which they depend. An ecosystem is self-supporting. In a woodland ecosystem, the plants absorb light and rainwater for photosynthesis; the animals feed on the plants and on each other.

A quadrat is a way of marking off square areas within a habitat, either by staking out an area with sticks and string, or by the use of a wood, plastic, or metal square placed on the ground. After setting the quadrats, ecologists then count the number of individuals that lie within their boundaries. The number and size of quadrat samples depends on the type of organisms under study and other factors, including the density of the organism. This ensures that enough individuals of the species are counted to get an accurate sample that correlates with the habitat, including areas not sampled. Attention\n144\nGrade 9 Biology "

In this section, we will briefly survey the terrestrial biomes, followed by the aquatic biomes. \nTerrestrial Biomes\nTerrestrial biomes vary greatly. For example, at the North Pole, the \nweather is very cold and there are no plants. As you move south, the weather gets warmer and there is a change in the size, number, and kinds of plants that cover the ground. As you continue south, the temperatures rise and you encounter forests.

Rain that falls throughout the year sums to an annual total of 130 to 200 centimetres. Regular rains, combined with an average temperature of 25\u00b0C (77\u00b0F) and little variation in day length, allow photosynthesis to continue year-round. \nPlants are vertically layered, and competition for light is intense \n(Fig.6.4). Broad-leaf evergreen trees are dominant in tropical rain forests. Tropical forests are home to millions of animal species. In fact, animal diversity is higher in tropical forests than in any other terrestrial biome. The animal species includes amphibians, birds and reptiles, mammals and arthropods. Deforestation is an ongoing threat to tropical rain forests. Tropical forests are located in developing countries with fast-growing human populations who look to the forest as a source of lumber, fuel, and potential agricultural land. Deforestation in any region leaves fewer trees to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.\nFigure 6. 4 Picture Tropical forest \nWhat is a desert?Deserts receive an average of less than 10 centimetres of rain per year.

Examples of desert biome include Chile\u2019s \nAtacama Desert and China\u2019s Gobi desert. Lack of rainfall keeps the \nhumidity in deserts low. With little water vapor to block the sun\u2019s rays, intense sunlight reaches and heats the ground. At night, the lack of insulating water vapour in the air allows the temperature to fall fast. \nThe plants include succulents such as cacti or euphorbs, deeply \nrooted shrubs, and herbs that grow during the infrequent moist periods (Fig.6.5). Desert plant adaptations include tolerance of heat and desiccation, water storage, and reduced leaf surface area. The desert fauna include snakes and lizards, scorpions, ants, beetles, migratory and resident birds, and seed-eating rodents. Many species are nocturnal. Water conservation is a common adaptation with \nsome species surviving solely on water obtained from breaking down carbohydrates in seeds. Urbanization and conversion to irrigated agriculture has reduced the natural biodiversity of some deserts.\nFigure 6. 5  Desert biome \nWhat are Savannas? \nThe Savanna biome occurs in equatorial and sub-equatorial regions. \nSavannas lie between the tropical forests and hot deserts of Africa, \nIndia, and Australia.

Lions and hyenas are carnivores that eat the grazers. \nDuring seasonal droughts, grazing mammals often migrate to parts \nof the savanna with more forage and scattered watering holes. The earliest humans may have lived in savannas. Fires set by humans may help maintain this biome, though overly frequent fires reduce tree regeneration by killing the seedlings and saplings.

Grass roots extend profusely through the thick topsoil and help hold it in place, preventing erosion by the constant winds. North America\u2019s grasslands are shortgrass and tallgrass prairies. During the 1930s, much of the shortgrass prairie of the American Great Plains was plowed to grow wheat. Tallgrass prairie has somewhat richer topsoil \nand slightly more frequent rainfall than shortgrass prairie. Nearly all tallgrass prairie has now been converted to cropland. The Tallgrass Prairie National Preserve was created in 1996 to protect the little that remains.

This biome has cold, dry winters and short, cool, wet summers. The annual precipitation is from 40 cm to 100 cm and usually takes the form of snow. Little evaporation occurs because of the cold temperatures.\nThe long and cold winters in the boreal forest have led to the \npredominance of cold-tolerant cone-bearing (coniferous) plants. These are evergreen coniferous trees like pines and spruce which retain their needle-shaped leaves year-round (Figure 6.8). This benefits evergreen trees, which grow faster than deciduous trees in the boreal forest. In addition, soils in boreal forest regions tend to be acidic with little available nitrogen.

In winter temperatures average 0\u00b0C while in summers, with temperatures up to 35\u00b0C, are hot and humid.\nThe dominant plants are deciduous trees, which drop their leaves \nbefore winter, when low temperatures would reduce photosynthesis and make water uptake from frozen soil difficult(Fig.6.9).Many mammals hibernate in winter, while many bird species migrate to warmer climates. \nTemperate broad-leaf forest has been heavily settled on all continents. \nLogging and land clearing for agriculture and urban development cleared virtually all the original deciduous forests in North America.

Wetlands are different from lakes \nbecause wetlands are shallow bodies of water.

Wetlands have a high capacity to filter dissolved nutrients and chemical pollutants (Fig.6.13).Wetlands are among the most productive biomes on Earth. \nWoody plants dominate the vegetation of swamps, while bogs are \ndominated by sphagnum mosses.

Lichens and mosses, which grow from windblown spores, are commonly the first macroscopic photosynthesizers to colonize such areas. Soil develops gradually as rocks weather and organic matter accumulates from the decomposed remains of the early colonizers. Once soil is present, the lichens and mosses are usually overgrown by grasses, shrubs, and trees that sprout from seeds blown in from nearby areas or carried in by animals. Eventually, an area is colonized by plants that become the community\u2019s dominant form of vegetation (climax community). Producing such a community through primary succession may take hundreds or thousands of years. Early-arriving species and later-arriving ones may be linked by one of three key processes- facilitating inhibiting and tolerating. .\nIn contrast to primary succession, secondary succession involves the \nre-colonization of an area after a major disturbance has removed most \nbut not all of the organisms in a community (Fig. 6. 17). Following the disturbance, the area may return to something like its original state. For instance, in a forested area that has been cleared for farming and later abandoned, the earliest plants to recolonize are often herbaceous species that grow from windblown or animal-borne seeds. If the area has not been burned or heavily grazed, woody shrubs may in time replace most of the herbaceous species, and forest trees may eventually replace most of the shrubs.\nFigure 6.17.

Weeds growing in a garden compete with garden plants for soil nutrients and water. Predators compete for prey such as hares.

Examples of herbivores include cattle, sheep, giraffe and goat. However, most herbivores are invertebrates, such as grasshoppers, caterpillars, and beetles (Fig. 6.20). Herbivores have many specialized adaptations. Many herbivorous insects have sensors on their feet that enable them to distinguish between plants based on their toxicity or nutritional value.
