In order \nto understand the complex nature of the economy, one needs to have a deeper \nunderstanding of each of the components in different market settings to realise how \nthe whole economy works. To this end, economists conventionally classify economics \ninto microeconomics and macroeconomics. \nThis student textbook covers basic topics in both microeconomics and macroeconomics. \nThe microeconomics part of the textbook introduces the fundamental economic \nconcepts such as scarcity, opportunity cost, and the laws of demand and supply. In \naddition, this part of the textbook covers the concepts of production and costs of \nproduction. The macroeconomics part of the textbook covers topics related to the \nconcepts of measurement and problems of economy-wide performance. \nThe objective of the textbook is to help students grasp the basic principles of Economics. \nIt also introduces students to macroeconomic tools, which provide students with the \nnecessary theoretical and analytical knowledge of basic economic concepts, thereby, \nincreasing the students\u2019 engagement in various practical and theoretical issues. \nFurthermore, it introduces students to the basic concepts of money, macroeconomics \nand entrepreneurship. Specifically, the textbook will: \n yIntroduce the students to fundamental concepts of economics in general and the \nbasics of microeconomics and macroeconomics in particular. \n yAcquaint the students with the basic concepts of demand, supply and market \nequilibrium. \n yIntroduce the students to the concepts of production and costs as well, thereby to \nunderstand how firms organize their production process and decide to minimize \ntheir costs. \n yIntroduce the students to the concepts of money, macroeconomics and \nentrepreneurship.\nThe textbook is organized into 8 units. Unit 1 focuses on introducing economics. \nUnit 2 deals with the basic economic problems and economic systems. Unit 3 focuses \non economic resources and markets. Unit 4 introduces the concepts of demand and \nsupply. Unit 5 deals with the concepts of production and cost. Unit 6 introduces the \nconcept of money. Unit 7 deals with introduction to macroeconomics. Finally, Unit 8 \npresents basic entrepreneurship.    "

This reveals that the subject of \neconomics was first studied in ancient Greece. Economics is a branch of the social \nsciences.\nEconomics is an important discipline, and its prominence has increased in recent years \nin response to worldwide economic problems. At present, poverty, unemployment, \ninflation, recession, population explosion, etc., are worldwide problems. In order to \nunderstand and find solutions to such problems, an in-depth knowledge of economics \nis essential.\nThe definition of economics has developed through time. Economic theory has \nadvanced over time, and different themes have gradually been included into the field. \nThere is no completed definition of economics yet, and the definition is essentially \nunder improvement in areas such as the wealth definition, the welfare definition and \nthe scarcity definition. \nBased on the above considerations, economics can be defined as follows.\nEconomics  is a branch of social science that studies the efficient allocation of scarce \nresources so as to attain the maximum fulfillment of human needs. As a science of \nchoice, economics studies how people choose to use scarce or limited productive \nresources (land, labour, equipment, technical knowledge, etc.) to produce various \ncommodities.\nThe following statements are derived from the above definition of economics:\n yEconomics studies about scarce resources;\n yIt studies about allocation of resources; \n yAllocation of resources should be efficient;"

Some economists consider economics a \u2018science\u2019 while \nothers consider it an \u201cart.\u201d\nEconomics as a Science \nScience produces a systematic and organised body of knowledge that links causes and \neffects. This knowledge can be regarded as the knowledge of \u201cwhat is\u201d. In economics, \nseveral facts are systematically collected, classified, analysed, and interpreted to make \npredictions about the future. In this sense, economics could be considered a science.\nEconomics as an Art \nOne of the important definitions of art is a technique or a way of doing or achieving \nsomething. When dealing with problems such as unemployment, poverty, and inflation, \neconomics provides principles and methods through which these problems can be \nsolved. Hence, economics extensively examines the nature and causes of economic \nproblems and sets the procedures for finding their solutions.

In pairs, \ndiscuss what the two branches are.\nThe field and scope of economics is growing rapidly and has come to encompass a wide \nrange of themes. Accordingly, different new branches of the subject have emerged over \ntime. Some of these branches are: development economics, environmental economics, \nindustrial economics, international economics, labor economics, mathematical \neconomics, monetary economics, welfare economics, resource economics, behavioural \neconomics, experimental economics, health economics, etc. However, the foundation \nof modern economics rests on two of its major branches, namely, microeconomics and \nmacroeconomics.\n Microeconomics\nMicroeconomics is concerned with the economic behavior of individual decision \nmaking units such as households, firms, and governments and their interactions \nand organizations through markets and industries. In other words, it deals with how \nhouseholds and firms make decisions and how they interact in specific markets. For \nexample, the economic activities of a consumer, a producer, a firm or an industry, the \nincome of individuals, the determination of prices of various products and factors of \nproduction, etc. fall under the scope of microeconomics. The fundamental problem \nof microeconomics is associated with resource allocation or the problem of price-\ndetermination. \nMacroeconomics \nMacroeconomics is a branch of economics that deals with the effects and consequences \nof the aggregate behaviour of all decision-making units in an economy. In other words, it \nexamines the interrelations among various aggregate economic variables. For example, \ntotal employment, total output, national income, total investment, total consumption, \netc. in an economy.

In contrast, macroeconomics is the study of \nan economy as a whole, and its focus is the study of broad, economy-wide aggregates. \nFor example, when we study the price determination of a commodity in a market, our \nstudy is micro-analysis and is treated by microeconomics, but if we study the trend \nof the general price level of commodities over time in a country, our study is macro-\nanalysis and is treated by macroeconomics. Note that both microeconomics and \nmacroeconomics are complementary to each other. In other words, macroeconomics \ncannot be studied independently of microeconomics.

Give your \njustification.\n  1\ufffd3\ufffd1 Methods of Studying Economics\nThe fundamental objective of economics, like any science, is the establishment of \nvalid generalisations about certain aspects of human behaviour. Those generalisations \nare known as theories. A theory is a simplified picture of reality. Economic theory \nprovides the basis for economic analysis, which uses logical reasoning. There are two \nmethods of logical reasoning, namely, deductive and inductive methods.\nDeductive Method \nThe deductive method proceeds from general to particular. It involves reasoning from \ncertain principles to the analysis of specific facts. In effect, it enables one to arrive at \na particular conclusion starting from a general statement. The conclusions are then \nverified against observed facts. Example: man is mortal. Abebe is a man. Therefore, \nAbebe is mortal.\nInductive Method\nThe inductive method is a process of reasoning from a part to the whole. This means \nit involves reasoning from the particular to the general or from the individual to the \ngeneral. In this method, economists approach problems of science from a practical \nangle, reducing the gulf between theory and practice. \nThe inductive method develops economic theories on the basis of observations and \nexperiments. In this method, comprehensive data about the prevailing economic \nconditions is collected. Then, an attempt is made to arrive at a hypothesis based on the \nobservations and the collected data.\nExample: During the harvest period, one may observe that the prices of grains decrease. \nThis may be associated with an increase in the supply of grain at that time of the year. \nFrom this observation, a generalisation can be made: \u201ckeeping other factors constant, \nan increase in supply leads to a fall in prices.\u201d"

Positive economics is like a science that \ndeals with knowledge and facts, while normative economics entails value judgment in \napplying the knowledge to solve problems.\nPositive  economics is concerned with the analysis of facts and attempts to describe \nthe world as it is. It tries to answer the questions: what is; what was; or what will be? \nIt does not judge a system as good or bad, better or worse.\nExamples:\n1. The number of secondary schools in Ethiopia is increasing.\n2. The current inflation rate in Ethiopia is 12 percent.\nBoth of the above statements are known as \u201cpositive statements.\u201d  These statements are \nconcerned with real facts and information. Any disagreement on positive statements \ncan be cleared up with reference to the facts.\nNormative economics is concerned with questions such as, \u201cwhat the economy ought \nto be?\u201d  Or what the economy should be? It evaluates the desirability of alternative \noutcomes based on one\u2019s value judgments about what is good and what is bad. In this \ncase, since normative economics is loaded with value judgments, what is good for an \nindividual may not be good for another. Normative analysis is a matter of opinion that \ncannot be proved or disproved with reference to facts. As a result, any disagreement \non a normative statement can be resolved through voting.\n Examples:\n1. The government should introduce school feeding programmes in all schools.\n2. There should be government intervention in the economy, whenever necessary.\n \u0102Activity 1 \ufffd3\n1. Describe the methods used to study economics.\n2.

These sections are sometimes known as \ndecision-making units of the economy. Customarily, they are described as economic \nagents. The basic decision making units of an economy are households, business firms, \nand the government. We discuss each of these decision making units of an economy \nas follows.\n1\ufffd Households \nHouseholds are the chief owners of the factors of production, which encompass land, \nlabour, capital, and entrepreneurship. They sell the services of these factors (termed \n\u201cfactor service\u201d) to producers and, in return, receive their income in the form of \nrent, wages, interest, and profit. They spend an enormous portion of their income on \npurchasing goods and services from the producers.Nonetheless, they save part of their \nincome, and also pay taxes to the government out of their income. \n2\ufffd  Business Firms \nIn economics, we use the terms \u201cbusiness firms\u201d and \u201cproducers\u201d alternately. Firms \nhire the services of factors of production from households to produce commodities that \nthey sell to households, to other firms, to the government or to other countries. Firms \nare the principal buyers of factors of production, and they are the leading producers \nof commodities. Business firms consist of both private and government enterprises.\n 3\ufffd  Government \nIn economics, government is taken in the sense of \u2018general government\u2019 in order to \ndisregard government enterprises. The government purchases goods and services from \nproducers and factors services from households. It uses these commodities and factor \nservices to provide free services, such as police, education, medical facilities, sanitation \nfacilities, judicial services, etc., to the people in order to satisfy their combined needs \nfor those services. The general government gets its income mainly from taxes levied \non households and on business firms in the form of direct and indirect taxes."

Economics has \ntwo main branches: microeconomics (deals with the economic behaviour of individual \neconomic units and individual economic variables) and macroeconomics (deals with \nthe functions of the economy as a whole).\nThe central objective of economics is the efficient utilisation of scarce resources to \nsatisfy unlimited human needs. Economics uses two methods of logical reasoning: \ndeductive (involves reasoning from certain principles to the analysis of specific facts) \nand inductive (involves reasoning from the particular to the general) methods. Further, \neconomics uses two approaches: positive economics (which deals with knowledge \nand facts) and normative economics (which entails value judgment in applying the \nknowledge to solve problems).\nAn economy is divided into different parts, which are sometimes called decision-\nmaking units. The basic decision making units of an economy are households (which are \nthe chief owners of factors of production: land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship), \nbusiness firms (which hire the services of factors of production from households to \nproduce commodities), and the government (which gets its income mainly from taxes \nlevied on households and business firms in the form of direct and indirect taxes)."

What do you mean by \nthese concepts?\nClearly, the scarcity of resources relative to unlimited human wants is a plain fact of \nlife. Households, producers, and the whole economy are faced with the problem of \nscarcity of natural and human-made resources. Consequently, it is necessary to use \nresources as efficiently as possible. In effect, resources should be allocated efficiently \namong the prevailing choices. Some basic economic concepts are described as follows.\n1\ufffd Scarcity \nThe fundamental economic problem that any human society faces is the problem of \nscarcity.\nScarcity refers to the fact that all economic resources that a society wants to use to \nproduce goods and services are finite or limited in supply. However, their being limited \nshould be expressed in relation to human wants. Thus, the term \u201cscarcity\u201d reflects \nthe imbalance between our wants and the means to satisfy those wants. Scarcity of \nresources generates economic problems. If resources were fully abundant, there would \nbe no economic problems at all.\nNote: Scarcity does not mean  shortage. A good is said to be scarce if the amount \navailable is less than the amount people wish to have at zero price. On the other hand, \nwe say that there is a shortage of goods and services when people are unable to get \nthe amount they want at the prevailing price. A shortage is a specific and short term \nproblem, while scarcity is a universal and endless problem.\n 2\ufffd Choice  \nIf resources are scarce, output will be limited. If output is limited, we cannot satisfy all \nof our wants. So, a choice must be made. Due to the problem of scarcity, individuals, "

In short, scarcity implies choice, which, in \nturn, implies an opportunity cost.\n Scarcity  \u2192 limited resource \u2192 limited output \u2192 unlimited human want\n   \u2192 Choice involves costs \u2192 opportunity cost\n3\ufffd Opportunity Cost\nIn a world of scarcity, a decision to have more of one thing, at the same time, means a \ndecision to have less of another thing. Thus, the value of the next best alternative that \nmust be sacrificed is the opportunity cost of the decision.\nDefinition: Opportunity cost is the amount or value of the next best alternative that \nmust be sacrificed (forgone) in order to obtain one more unit of a product.\nFor example, suppose the country spends all of its limited resources on the production \nof cloth or computer. If a given amount of resources can produce either one meter of \ncloth or 20 computers, then the opportunity cost of one meter of cloth is the value of \n20 computers.\n Note the following points about opportunity cost:\n yIt is measured in terms of goods and services but not in terms of money .\n yIt should be in line with the principle of substitution of one activity for another .\nTo sum up, when the opportunity cost of any activity increases people substitute other \nactivities in its place. In effect, the cost of producing a quantity of a commodity is \nmeasured in terms of the quantity of some other commodity that could have been \nproduced in its place. In short, opportunity cost comes into being due to the problem \nof scarcity of resources and the fact that resources have alternative uses.\n 4. The Production Possibilities Frontier \nThe production possibilities frontier or curve (PPF/PPC) is a curve, which shows the \nvarious possible combinations of goods and services that the society can produce \ngiven its resources and technology. To draw the PPF/PPC we need the following \nassumptions.\n1. The quantity and quality of economic resource available for use during the \nyear is fixed.\n2. There are two broad classes of output to be produced over the year .\n3. The economy is operating at full employment and is achieving full production. \n15"

Related to the opportunity cost, we have a law known as the law \nof increasing opportunity cost. This law states that as we produce more and more \nof a product, the opportunity cost per unit of the additional output increases.

These problems are common to all economic \nsystems. They are also referred to as central problems of an economy.\nConsequently, every modern society should answer the following three basic questions:  \n1.

For whom goods and services are to be produced? \nEach of these basic questions is briefly discussed as follows.\n1\ufffd What goods and services are to be produced? \nThis question is also called the problem of the allocation of resources. It implies that \nevery economy must decide on the type and quantity of goods to be produced. The \neconomy must make choices between the productions of: consumption and capital \ngoods, civil and military goods, and necessity and luxury goods.\n2. How to produce goods and services? \nThis question is also referred to as the problem of choice of technique. Once an economy \nhas reached a decision regarding the types of goods and services to be produced, \nand has determined their respective quantities, it must decide how to produce them, \nwhich entails choosing between alternative methods or techniques of production. For \nexample, wheat can be produced using primitive tools and manual labour, or using \nmodern machinery and some labour.\nThe various techniques of production can be classified into two groups: labour-\n19"

A labour-intensive technique \ninvolves the use of more labour, relative to capital, per unit of output. In contrast, a \ncapital-intensive technique involves the use of more capital, relative to labour, per unit \nof output. The choice between these techniques depends on the available supplies of \ndiverse production factors and their relative prices. Making a good choice is important \nfor making the best possible use of limited resources to produce the maximum number \nof goods and services.\n3. For whom are goods and services to be produced? \nThis problem is also called the problem of the distribution of the national product of \na country. It relates to how a material product is to be distributed among the different \nmembers of a society. \nThe economy should decide, for instance, whether to produce for the benefit of a few \nrich people or for the majority of poor people. An economy that wants to produce \nfor the benefit of the maximum number of people would first try to focus on the \nproduction of necessary goods for the whole population, and then on the production \nof luxury goods.\nAll these, and other fundamental economic problems, focus on human needs and \nwants.

How do you classify them?\n The way a society tries to answer the basic economic questions mentioned above can \nbe summarized by a concept known as the \u201ceconomic system.\u201d An economic system \nis a set of organizational and institutional arrangements established to answer the \nbasic economic questions. The different types of economic systems are classified on \nthe basis of ownership of economic resources. The main types of economic systems \nare: traditional economy or subsistence, capitalist economy, command economy, and \nmixed economy. These economic systems are discussed as follows.  \n1\ufffd Traditional Economy  \nA traditional economy is a system that relies on customs, history, and time-honored \nbeliefs. Tradition guides economic decisions such as production and distribution. \nSocieties with traditional economies depend on agriculture, fishing, hunting, gathering, \nor some combination of them. They use barter instead of money.  \nMost traditional economies operate in  emerging markets and developing countries. \nThey are often in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East. Traditional \neconomies can also be found in pockets throughout the world, even in developing \ncountries.\nMain features of Traditional Economy\n yTraditional economies centre on a family or tribe, and they use traditions gained \nfrom the elders\u2019 experiences to guide day-to-day life and economic decisions.\n yA traditional economy exists in a hunter-gatherer and nomadic society: These \nsocieties cover vast areas to find enough food to support them. They follow the \nherds of animals that sustain them, migrating with the seasons. These nomadic \nhunter-gatherers compete with other groups for scarce natural resources. There \nis little need for trade since they all consume and produce the same things.  \n yMost traditional economies produce only what they need. There is rarely a \nsurplus or leftovers. That makes it unnecessary to trade or create money.\n21"

            "text": "Unit 2:The Basic Economic Problems and  Economic Systems22 yWhen traditional economies do trade, they rely on  barter. It can only occur \nbetween groups that do not compete.  For example, a tribe that relies on hunting \nexchanges food with a group that relies on fishing. Because they just trade meat \nfor fish, there is no need for cumbersome currency.\n yThey start to  evolve  once they start farming and settling down.  They are more \nlikely to have a surplus, such as a bumper crop, that they use for trade. When \nthat happens, the groups create some form of money. That facilitates trading \nover long distances.  \n 2\ufffd Capitalist Economy (Capitalism) \nCapitalism is the oldest formal economic system in the world. It became widespread \nin the middle of the 19th century. In this economic system, all means of production \nare privately owned, and production takes place at the initiative of individual private \nentrepreneurs who work mainly for their own profit. Government intervention in \nthe economy is negligible. This system is also referred to as a free market economy, \nsimply a market economy, or laissez faire.\nMain features of Capitalist Economy\n yThe Right to Private Property: This is the central feature of a capitalist economy. \nAccording to the principle of capitalism, all economic or productive factors, \nincluding land, factories, machinery, mines, etc. are under private ownership.\n yFreedom of Choice by Consumers: Consumers can buy the goods and services \nthat suit their tastes and preferences. Producers produce goods in accordance with \nthe demands of consumers. This is called the principle of consumer sovereignty.\n yCompetition: In a capitalist economy, competition exists among sellers or \nproducers of similar goods to attract customers. Among buyers, there is \ncompetition to obtain goods. Among workers, the competition is to get jobs. \nAmong employers, it is to get workers and investment funds.\n yLimited government involvement  : The government does not interfere in day-\nto-day economic activities but confines itself to defence and the maintenance of \nlaw and order.\n ySelf-Interest: Self-interest guides and motivates individuals in the economy to \nstrive for economic gain.\n yInequalities in income: In the capitalist economy, there is a large income \ninequality between the rich and the poor."

Socialism started in Russia with the outbreak of the Great October Revolution in \n1917. Since then, many countries in the world, including China, Vietnam, former East \nGermany, Poland, Hungary, Cuba, and Ethiopia, have adopted it. Several countries \nadopted this system after the Second World War. Nevertheless, socialism lost its \nacceptance and most of the former socialist countries adopted free market economies.\nMain features of Command Economy\n yCollective Ownership: All means of production are owned by society as a whole, \nand there is no right to private property.\n yCentral Economic Planning : Resource allocation is done by the controlling \nauthority based on socio-economic goals.\n yStrong Role of Government: Government has complete control over all economic \nactivities.\n yRelative Equality of Incomes: Private property does not exist in a command \neconomy, the profit motive is absent, and there are no opportunities for the \naccumulation of wealth. In comparison to capitalism, all these factors lead to \ngreater equality in income distribution in income terms.\n 4\ufffd Mixed Economy\nA mixed economy is one of the economic systems having the combination of both \nthe characteristics of capitalism and socialism: a combination of private and public \nownership of the means of production, with some measures of control by the \ngovernment. It incorporates some of the features of both capitalist and command \neconomies and allows private and public sectors to co-exist.\n Main Features of Mixed Economy \n yCo-existence of Public and Private Sectors:  Public and private sectors co-\nexist in this system. Their respective roles and aims are well-defined. Industries \nof national and strategic importance, such as heavy and basic industry, defence \nservices, power generation, etc. are set up in the public sector, whereas the \nconsumer-goods industry and small-scale industry are developed in the private \nsector.\n23"

These problems are common to all economies in the world. They \nare also known as central problems of economies. These problems originate from the \nscarcity of resources. Scarcity is the imbalance between unlimited human wants and \nlimited available resources. In effect, it is the tension between the unlimited human \nwants and the means of satisfying them. The fundamental economic problem focuses \naround the unlimited human wants and limited means of satisfying those wants. Many \nhuman efforts in any society are directed towards the production of goods and services \nin order to satisfy the demand of the society for those goods and services.\nProduction Possibility Curve (PPC) is a curve that depicts all possible combinations \nof the maximum output that can be produced in an economy with given resources \nand technology. The PPC describes the concepts of scarcity, choice and opportunity \ncost. Linked to the opportunity cost, there is a law known as the law of increasing \nopportunity cost, which states that as we produce more and more of a product, the \nopportunity cost per unit of the additional output increases. This makes the shape of \nthe PPC concave to the origin. \nThe way a society tries to answer the basic economic questions is summarised by a \nconcept known as an economic system. An economic system is a set of organisational \nand institutional arrangements established to answer basic economic questions. In \neconomics, there are four basic economic systems. These are traditional, capitalist, \ncommand, and mixed economies.\n25"

There are two types of resources; namely, free \nresources and economic resources.\nFree resources: A resource is said to be free if the amount available to a society \nis greater than the amount people desire to have at zero price. In other words, free \nresources are the free gifts of nature, which are unlimited in supply and have no prices. \nFor example, air, sunshine, solar energy, and a mountain stream.\nEconomic (Scarce) Resources:  A resource is said to be economic or scarce when the \namount available to a society is less than what people want to have at zero price. Since \neconomic resources are scarce or not available in plenty, they have non-zero prices. \nPrice is the test of whether a resource is an economic or a free good.\nExamples of scarce resources are:\n yAll types of human resources: manual, intellectual, skilled and specialized labor;\n yMost natural resources, like land (especially fertile land), minerals, clean water, \nforests, and wild animals,\n yAll types of capital resources (like machines, intermediate goods, and \ninfrastructure) and\n yAll types of entrepreneurial resources.\nGenerally, we can divide economic resources into four broad categories. These are \nland, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship. Each of these categories is briefly described \nbelow.\n yLabour : refers to the physical as well as mental efforts of human beings in \nthe production and distribution of goods and services. The reward for labour is \nwage.\n yLand: refers to the natural resources, or all the free gifts of nature, used in the \nproduction of goods and services. The reward for the services of the land is rent."

These \nresources have been broadly classified into two categories: renewable resources and \nnon-renewable resources.\nRenewable resources  are resources that have the potential to be replaced over time \nthrough natural processes. The renewal process may be relatively quick, as with \nsunshine, which comes on a daily basis. Or else, the renewal process may be very slow, \nas in the formation of soil, which may take hundreds of years. Examples of renewable \nresources are solar energy, wind energy, soil, trees, grass, geothermal pressure, and \nground water.\nNon-renewable resources  are resources whose stock or reserve is limited or fixed, and \nwhich are found in the ground. The available supply of non-renewable resources may \nbe replenished through recycling, but the overall supply remains relatively constant. \nExamples of non-renewable resources are natural gas, coal, steel, aluminum, and oil.\nAll natural resources should be used wisely. We must  conserve  natural resources. \n\u201cConserve means not misusing, spoiling, or wasting things. This is especially true \nfor nonrenewable resources. However, even some renewable natural resources can be \n31"

Pollution occurs when people put harmful chemicals and \nother things into nature. Oil spilled into water, toxic chemicals in the air, or garbage \ndumped on the side of the road are examples of this problem.\nConservation of natural resources\nTo conserve natural resources, you can reduce, reuse, and recycle them. For example, \nturn off the lights when you are not in a room. This will reduce the use of fossil fuels \nused to generate electricity. Ride your bicycle and walk more, to reduce the amount \nof gasoline used to transport you. You can reuse things. Things like plastic jugs, jars, \npaper, and bags can be reused. Each time you reuse something, you conserve the \nnatural resources that would have been used to make the new one.\nFinally, you can recycle. Recycling means reusing a natural resource or product to \nmake something new. It also means collecting and sending these things for reuse. \nItems that can be easily recycled include: glass, some plastics, paper, cardboard, \naluminum, and steel. Some plastics and metals are hard to recycle. They are often \nmade from mixtures of materials. Mixtures can be hard to separate. Try to buy and use \nthings that you can recycle.\nIn general, natural resources, both renewable and nonrenewable, are important to all \nof us. We must conserve and carefully use natural resources.

This model gives an overview \nof how households, businesses, and the government interact in different markets \nby exchanging goods and services, productive resources (inputs or the factors of \nproduction), and money.\nProduction, exchange and consumption are three important activities of an economy. \nAs people carry out these economic activities, transactions among different sectors of \nthe economy occur. Because of these transactions, income and expenditure move in \na circular way in an economy. This is called circular flow of income or circular flow \ndiagram. Before we illustrate and explain the circular flow of income in an economy, \nlet\u2019s consider the different sectors into which an economy is divided for this purpose. \nThese sectors are also sometimes known as decision-making units of the economy. \nGenerally, they are called economic agents.\nDefinition: A circular flow of income is a visual model of an economy that shows \nhow a currency, such as the Birr, flows through markets among decision-\nmaking units.\nCircular flows of income and expenditure\nA circular flow is a pictorial representation of the continuous flow of payments and \nreceipts for goods and services and factor services among different sectors of the \neconomy. It also refers to the process whereby the income and expenditure of an \neconomy flow in a circular manner continuously through time. \nTypes of flows\nEconomic transactions, like the sale and purchase of goods and factor services, generate \ntwo types of flows, namely, real flows and money flows. Real flow and money flow are \nthe two main aspects of the circular flow of income model. Both refer to exchanges \nof goods and services for money, but the two concepts differ in how they refer to the \nopposite sides of these exchanges as they relate to individuals and companies. "

In the context of agriculture, land refers to \nareal extent as well as its productivity of food crops and other crops. It is well-known \nthat Ethiopia has a total area of 1,106,000 square kilometers of which 35 per cent is \nconsidered to be suitable for agriculture(CSA, 2007). The availability of this amount \nof land for agricultural purposes is directly or indirectly the result of good soil and \nsuitable climate for the performance of agriculture. \nAs far as the types of soil are concerned, most of the highlands have two main soil \ntypes that are generally believed to be suitable for agriculture. These soil types are: \n yRed-to-reddish brown soils: These soil types are well endowed with the required \nminerals for crops and they are found in areas of relatively good drainage. \nFurther, these soil types are friable \u2013 easy to plough. \n yBrownish-to-grey and black soils with high clay content: With proper drainage \nand conditioning, these soils have excellent agricultural potentials. \nRegarding the climatic aspect, the formation of different agro-ecological zones due \nto altitude has multiplied the resource potential of the land of Ethiopia. The presence \nof different agro-climate zones results in the growth of different types of crops that \nincreases Ethiopia\u2019s potential for the production of exportable items in order to earn \nforeign currency.\nThe Ethiopian people had been struggling for centuries with the inequitable land \nholdings of the country and effectively removed the feudal system in 1975. The \nsocialist system that came into being in 1975 under the slogan \u201cLand to The Tiller\u201d \nparadoxically overturned the slogan and ended up in state ownership rather than \ngiving it to the people. The existing government, which controlled power in 1991, \nwas expected to remove land rights problems, among others by giving land to the \npeople in tenure. But it maintained state ownership of land and controls all urban and \nrural land together with natural resources. Although state controls land ownership, \nrural peasants and pastoralists are guaranteed lifetime \u201cholding\u201d right that gives all "

A resource is said to be free if the amount \navailable to a society is greater than the amount people desire to have at zero price. \nWhile a resource is said to be economic when the amount available to a society is less \nthan what people want to have at zero price.\nRenewable resources are resources that have the potential to be replaced over time \nthrough the natural processes. While non-renewable resources are resources whose \nstock or reserve is limited or fixed, which are found in the ground. The available \nsupply of non-renewable resources may be replenished by recycling but the overall \nsupply remains relatively constant.\nA market is a place where two parties can meet to facilitate the exchange of goods \nand services. The parties involved are usually buyers and sellers. The market may be \nphysical like a retail outlet, where people meet face-to-face, or digital like an online \nmarket, where there is no direct physical contact between buyers and sellers. There \nare three markets discussed in this section, namely, goods and services market, labour \nmarket, and financial market.\nThe circular flow of economic activities is a simplified macroeconomic model of the \nbasic economic relationships in a market economy. This model gives an overview \nof how households, businesses and government interact in different markets by \nexchanging goods and services, productive resources and money.\nFor a country like Ethiopia, where agriculture is the backbone of the economy, land is \na very important economic resource. In the context of agriculture, land refers to areal \nextent as well as its productivity of food crops and other crops."

Demand states that the consumer \nmust be willing and able to buy a commodity which he or she desires at a given price \nduring a given period of time. \nAccordingly, demand is distinct from a mere desire to acquire something. Human \nwants are unlimited and desires are numerous. However, only a desire backed up by \nthe ability to pay the price for the commodity and the willingness to purchase it, is \ncalled a demand. We can say demand refers to an effective desire. A desire becomes an \neffective demand only when it is backed by the following three features: \n yability to pay for the good desired, \n ywillingness to pay the price of the good desired, and \n yavailability of the good itself \nFurthermore, demand for a good is constantly stated relative to a specific price and \ncertain time. For instance, an individual may be interested to buy a certain jeans at a \nprice of Birr 500, but he or she could not absolutely demand it if its price is Birr 900. \nLikewise, an individual may be willing to buy a room heater at a price of Birr 1000 \nduring a cold season, but he or she may not be interested in buying it at this price \nduring a hot season. \nBased on the aforementioned considerations, we can define demand as follows: \nDemand for a commodity is the amount of it that a consumer is willing to \nbuy at various given prices and a given moment of time.\nQuantity Demanded\nQuantity demanded is the amount of commodity a consumer must be willing and able \nto buy which he/she desires at a given price during a given period of time.

Stock is the total volume of a commodity produced during a period less the \nquantity already sold out. Conversely, supply means the quantity which is actually \nbrought to the market. Most of the time, producers do not offer all of their stock for \nsale in the market. For example, at the time of harvest, a large part of agricultural \nproduct is kept back in cold storage and is taken out during the off-season for sale at \nbetter prices. Likewise, a part of industrial product is usually kept back in stock and \nis offered for sale in the market at the time when it can bring higher prices. Thus, we \ncan say that stock is potential supply and supply may be less than or equal to the stock \nof a commodity. However, in economics, the term supply has a specific meaning and \nit is described as: \nSupply of a commodity refers to the various quantities of it which producers are \nwilling and able to offer for sale at a particular time at various corresponding prices.\nQuantity Supplied\nQuantity Supplied indicates various quantities of a commodity that sellers (producers) \nare willing and able to provide at different prices in a given period of time. In \neconomics, quantity supplied describes the number of goods or services that suppliers \nwill produce and sell at a given market price. The quantity supplied differs from \nthe actual amount of supply as price changes influence how much supply producers \nactually put on the market. \nNote that supply shows the relationship between the quantity supplied and price of \na commodity, while quantity supplied refers to a specific amount of the commodity, \nwhich a producer is willing to sell at a specific price.\nLaw of Supply  \nLike the law of demand, the law of supply demonstrates the quantities sold at a specific \n47"

Demand and \nsupply curves tell us how much consumers demand and how much producers supply \nat different prices, respectively. However, they do not tell us the actual price of a good \nin general. We now come to the important question: How do the forces of demand and \nsupply work together in order to determine market prices? We explain how forces of \ndemand and supply help in attaining \u2018equilibrium\u2019, and how the \u2018equilibrium price\u2019 is \ndetermined. \nThe concept of equilibrium \nThe term \u201cequilibrium\u201d refers to a state of balance. In the physical world, when two \nopposing forces acting on an object are balanced so that the object is held stationary, \nthe object is said to be in equilibrium. In simple terms, when the object under the action \nof forces working in opposite directions has no tendency to move in any direction, the \nobject is in equilibrium. Similarly, an economic system is said to be in equilibrium \nwhen its important variables show no change, and when no forces are acting on them to \nproduce a change in their values. For instance, after attaining equilibrium, a consumer \nhas no intention of re-allocating his or her money or income. Likewise, a firm is said \nto be in equilibrium when it has no tendency to change its level of output by either \nincreasing or decreasing it. Thus, there is a tendency to move towards the equilibrium \nprice. This tendency is known as the \u201cmarket mechanism,\u201d and the resulting balance \nbetween supply and demand is called \u201cmarket equilibrium.\u201d\nIn real world economic activities, equilibrium may never be actually realised. The \ncentral feature of equilibrium analysis in economics is the concept that economies \ntend towards equilibrium when no external forces are acting on them.\nMarket equilibrium \nIn the context of price determination, equilibrium refers to a situation in which the \nquantity demanded of a commodity equals the quantity supplied of the commodity.

            "text": "Unit 5: Introduction to Production and Cost56Production is a process of combining various inputs to produce an output for \nconsumption. It is the act of creating output in the form of a commodity or a service \nwhich contributes to the utility of individuals. In other words, it is a process in which \nthe inputs are converted into outputs. For example, when we produce wheat on a plot \nof land with the help of inputs like labour, capital and seeds, it is termed as production \nof wheat. \nInputs are economic resources that can be used in the production of goods and services. \nIn economics, there four basic inputs commonly used in the production of goods and \nservices. These are labour, capital, land and entrepreneurial ability. \nOutputs are inputs transformed into final usable form since inputs give less satisfaction \nto the consumer by themselves. In other words, outputs are consequences of the \nproduction process. \nWe can classify outputs into tangible and intangible ones. Tangible outputs are physical \nproducts that can be touched. Intangible outputs are products, which may have value \nbut are not physical objects. The main difference between tangible and intangible \noutputs is that tangible output is something that a person can see or touch, and thus it \nhas a physical existence while intangible output is something, which a person cannot \nsee or touch and thus it does not have any physical existence.\nExamples of tangible outputs include: building, machinery, equipment, car, etc. that \nhave long term physical existence. Examples of intangible outputs include: insurance \ncoverage, consultancy service, computer software, educational training, health care \nservice, etc. that cannot often be tried out, inspected, or tested in advance.\nType of Inputs \nInputs can be divided into two main groups \u2013 fixed and variable inputs. A fixed input is \none whose quantity cannot be varied during the period under consideration. Building \nand machinery are examples of fixed inputs. An input whose quantity can be changed \nduring the period under consideration is known as a variable input. Raw materials and \nlabour inputs are examples of variable inputs. \n \u0102Activity 5 \ufffd1\n1. Make a classroom observation and explain the inputs used in the teaching-\nlearning process. \n2.

The two periods of production are commonly known as short run and \nlong run. \nShort run  refers to a period of production in which at least one of the inputs is fixed \nwhile the remaining is variable. This implies that an increase in output in the short-run \ncan be brought about by increasing those inputs that can be varied,-which are known \nas \u2018variable inputs\u2019. For example, if a producer wishes to increase output in the short-\nrun, she/he can do so by using more of variable factors like labour and raw materials.\nLong run  refers a period of production in which all inputs are variable or there is no \nfixed input. A firm can install a new plant or construct a new factory building. Long-\nrun is the period during which the size of the plant can be changed. Thus, all the \nfactors of production are variable in the long-run.\nIt must be understood that when we say short run and long run it does not necessarily \nmean a relatively short or long period of time like one year or less than one year or like \ntwo or five years. It rather refers to the nature of economic arrangement of the inputs \nin response to the changing economic environment.\nTotal Product, Average Product and Marginal Product in the Short Run\nThe productivity of variable inputs can be measured in different forms:\nTotal product (TP):  -it is the overall amount of output produced by the factors of \nproduction employed over a given period. It is the gross or entire output by workers \nand expressed in terms of Quantity (Q). In the short run production function, a firm \nobtains its total product by using a combination of variable inputs with specific amount \nof fixed inputs.\nAverage product (AP): -  a firm\u2019s average product is obtained by dividing the total \n57"

Productivity is \na measure of output per unit input (i.e. output ratio for each level of input and the \ncorresponding level of output).\nMarginal Product (MP ): - holding the quantities of other factors constant, the in -\ncrease in output which results from using one additional or extra unit of a single factor \ninput, is called the marginal physical product or simply marginal product.

The cost of production generally \nrefers to the monetary outlays associated with production activity, or it is the total \nexpenditures and sacrifices made in the entire process of production and distribution \nof goods and services.\nTypes of Cost of Production\n1\ufffd Explicit and implicit costs\nExplicit costs:  These are the actual monetary payments or cash outlays that business \nfirms make to outsiders who are suppliers of inputs or resources to them. For example, \nthe rewards of labour, land, capital, and entrepreneurs are all costs for a business \nfirm that employs them in certain production processes. In addition, there are other \npayments made for other raw materials, fuel, transport, sieve, power, and the like are \nall costs to a firm. Such costs are usually termed \u201caccounting costs\u201d because they are \nout-of-pocket costs. Thus, accounting cost refers to the cost of purchased inputs only, \nand this only refers to the explicit cost.\nImplicit costs: are costs standing for the values of non-purchased resources owned \nand used by firms in their own production activities. These are costs of firms\u2019 own \nand self-employed resources in carrying out activities such as the salary of an owner-\nmanager or the estimated rent of a building that belongs to the owner of a firm, etc. \nThe values of these self-owned resources should be estimated from what they could \nearn in their best alternative uses.\n2\ufffd Economic Cost and Accounting Costs\nIt is obvious that costs and profits are inseparable concepts of business.

It considers only direct \nexpenses such as wages/salaries, cost of raw materials, depreciation allowances, \ninterest on borrowed funds and utility expenses (electricity, water, telephone, etc.). \nThese costs are said to be explicit costs. Explicit costs are out of pocket expenses for \nthe purchased inputs.\n3\ufffd Fixed and Variable Costs\nFixed costs  are those costs that do not vary as the firm changes the level of output. \nThese are costs that are always incurred even if the firm does not produce anything. \nThese are also costs of fixed inputs. For example. rents on leased properties, interest \non borrowed funds, the wear and tear of machineries, cost of administrative staff, etc. \nVariable costs  are those costs of production that directly vary with the level of output \nof the firm. When output is zero variable costs are also zero. But as the firm expands \nits output these costs tend to rise. In short, variable costs of a firm are dependent on \nthe level of output.

Moreover, \nthe TFC curve is parallel to the quantity axis and has 60 birr above it. However, \nTVC is zero when output is zero and rises as output rises. The TVC initially rises at \na decreasing rate, but later on it increases at an increasing rate. This is true because \nthe firm initially uses few variable inputs with fixed inputs and at this point the TVC \nincreases at a decreasing rate.

For this reason, the TC \ncurve has the same shape as TVC.\nAverage Total Cost (ATC): This is the total cost per unit output and is calculated by \ndividing the total cost by the quantity produced.

What does it look like?\nEconomists define money as generally accepted in payment for goods or services or \nin the repayment of debts. When most people talk about money, they are talking about \ncurrency. If, for example, someone comes up to you and shouts loudly, \u201cyour money \nor your life,\u201d you should quickly handover all your currency rather than risk your life. \nYou would not ask, \u201cWhat exactly do you mean by money?\u201d\nMoney is any good that is widely used and accepted in transactions involving the \ntransfer of goods and services from one person to another. Money is a commodity \naccepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange. It serves as the \nmedium for expressing prices and values; as currency, it circulates anonymously from \nperson to person and country to country, facilitating trade and serving as the primary \nmeasure of wealth.\nAn essential characteristic that money has is that it is immediately exchangeable for \nall kinds of marketable assets, such as goods and services, real estate, or whatever. \nEach person accepts money as a means of payment because he/she is confident that \nothers will accept it as payment for him/her. The social convention could either be \nestablished through legal or other means. For a commodity to be accepted as money, \nit must meet the following criteria.\n yStandardization:  it must be easily standardized, making it simple to ascertain \nits value.\n yAcceptability: It must be widely accepted as a medium of exchange.\n yDivisibility:  It must be divisible so that it is easy to make a change.\n yPortability:  it must be easy to carry.\n yDurability \u2013 it should not degrade quickly.\nMoney may be any commodity chosen by common consent as a medium or instrument \nof exchange. All other commodities are thus expressed and valued in terms of that \ncommodity regarded as money. Such a commodity should be recognizable and \nacceptable to all who use it as a medium of exchange. It is a commodity that is accepted "

Human needs were \nsimple, and almost everybody satisfied them by producing whatever the individual \nrequired. The individual provided the bare necessities of life. The individual was \nself-sufficient in the sense that everybody engaged in hunting and gathering for food, \nmade their own clothing, and had their own dwelling. Economic activities were, thus, \nconfined to production and consumption.\nIn the course of time, humans gained knowledge through learning by doing, formed \nfamilies, and their individual needs increased. Human beings realize that now it is not \npossible for them to satisfy their rising needs by producing everything for themselves. \nAs a result, self-sufficiency came to an end and the process of exchange started.\nBartering\nInitially, the exchange was direct. That is, it was an exchange of goods for goods. Such \nan exchange is known as \u201cbarter.\u201d Under the barter system, an individual produces \ngoods in greater quantities than they could be consumed, so as to exchange the surplus \nwith another person for something the producer needs in return. The economy based \nupon this system of exchange is called the barter economy .\nLimitations of the barter system: A direct exchange of one good for another without \nthe mediation of money has a number of difficulties associated with it.

The barter system requires that a person having a surplus of one \ncommodity be able to find another person who not only wants that commodity \nbut also has something acceptable to offer in exchange.\n yLack of a common measure of value: Different commodities have different \nvalues. There is no common value under the barter system. For example, if a \nsheep is to be exchanged for wheat, it is difficult to decide in what proportion \nthe two goods are to be exchanged. Thus, it is difficult to settle the terms of \nexchange.\n yIndivisibility of commodities: There are many goods which are indivisible. If \nsomeone wants to exchange a horse for getting a pair of shoes, the person will \nhave to part with a portion of the horse on the basis of the exchange ratio. In this \nprocess, the horse loses its identity and value as a horse. Hence, the exchange is \nunthinkable.\n yDifficulty in storing and transferring wealth: Most goods, such as rice, wheat, \ncattle, skin, and so on, lose their value over time or involve high storage costs. \nFurther, the transfer of these goods from one place to another involves a huge \ntransportation cost.\n yDifficulty in differed payments: In the barter exchange system, payment is not \nalways made right away, but rather after some time has passed. This is because \nthere is an absence of stability in the prices of goods. Besides, there is an absence \nof quality and general acceptability in goods. In this way, it is very difficult to \nmake different payments in the form of goods.\nThe history of money (in Ethiopia and the global context) \nWhen the barter system was replaced by the monetary system, primitive money was \nfirst used in the form of commodity money. The choice of the particular commodity \nto be used as money was determined by factors such as the location of the community \nand the economic development of the community.\nThe problem with a payment system based exclusively on commodity money, is it a \nprecious metal or any other valuable commodity, is that such a form of money is very \nheavy and is hard to transport from one place to another.\nThe next development in the payments system was paper currency (pieces of paper \nthat function as a medium of exchange). Initially, paper currency embodied a promise \nthat it was convertible into coins or into a quantity of precious metal.\nIn most countries, however, currency has evolved into fiat money, paper currency \ndecreed by governments as legal tender (meaning that legally it must be accepted as "

Paper currency \nhas the advantage of being much lighter than coins or precious metal, but it can be \naccepted as a medium of exchange only if there is some trust in the authorities who \nissue it and printing has reached a sufficiently advanced stage that counterfeiting is \nextremely difficult.\nPaper currency and coins have the major drawbacks of being easily stolen and being \nexpensive to transport because of their bulk if there are large amounts. To combat \nthis problem, another step in the evolution of the payments system occurred with the \ndevelopment of modern banking: the invention of checks. In this case, someone will \nhave a checking account at a bank and can write checks whenever he wants to make \nsome payment, and the holder of the check can cash it at the bank.\nChecks are payable on demand, which allows transactions to take place without the \nneed to carry around large amounts of currency. The introduction of checks was a \nmajor innovation that improved the efficiency of the payments system. The use of \nchecks thus reduces the transportation costs associated with the payment system and \nimproves economic efficiency. Another advantage of checks is that they can be written \nfor any amount up to the balance in the account, making transactions for large amounts \nmuch easier. Checks are advantageous in that loss from theft is greatly reduced, and \nthey provide convenient receipts for purchases.\nWith the development of the computer and advanced telecommunications technology, \nthere would seem to be a better way to organize our payments system.

With the fall of the kingdom, however, the coins disappeared from circulation \nand, since then, in Ethiopia, various commodities like a bar of salt (amole), cloth, beads, \netc., have been used as money. The most important and widely spread one, however, \nwas salt. Until, the emergence of Maria Theresa, salt was the most popular medium of \nexchange.

The coin was first minted in Vienna \nin 1751 to commemorate the coronation of Maria Theresa as empress of Austria. \nInterestingly enough, this coin was not used as a legal currency in its country of origin. \nIt is believed that Maria Theresa was introduced into Ethiopia by traders between the \nlate 18th and early 19th century. Maria Theresa served as a medium of exchange until \n1945. Although it was not as popular as Maria Theresa, the first national coin was \nminted by Emperor Menelik II, in 1893. Menelik\u2019s coins were replaced by the new \nmetallic coins issued in July 1933 bearing the image of the Emperer Haileselassie.\nPaper money was issued by the Bank of Abyssinia for the first time in 1914. However, \nit was unusual in society, and it failed to gain acceptance because most people were \nonly familiar with metallic coins. Paper money was again issued by the Bank of \nEthiopia (the successor of the Bank of Abyssinia) in 1932. These notes were 100 \npercent backed by gold deposits and thus served as a medium of exchange alongside \nthe salt bar and the Maria Theresa until the Italian occupation in 1936.In 1941, when \nthe country was liberated from the brief Italian occupation, it had no national currency \nand no financial institutions. Following the restoration of independence in 1941, many \nforeign currencies started to be used as mediums of exchange, including the Italian \nLire, the Maria Theresa Dollar, the East African Shilling, the Indian Rupee, and the \nEgyptian Pound, circulating as a medium of exchange. While the lire was a holdover \nfrom the Italian occupation and the Maria Theresa Dollar was a carryover from earlier \nperiods, the rest of the currencies were introduced by British military forces who \nhelped liberate the country and took over administration. It was only in July 1945 \nthat the Ethiopian government issued the new national currency, the Birr.

All of these functions play \nsignificant roles in the operation of the economy.\n1\ufffd The medium of exchange functions\nThe most basic function of money is to serve as a medium of exchange. In almost all \nmarket transactions in our economy, money in the form of currency or checks is a \nmedium of exchange. It is used to pay for goods and services.\nAlthough money has no power to satisfy human wants directly, it does have the power \nto purchase those things that have utility and satisfy human wants. Using money as a \nmedium of exchange promotes economic efficiency by eliminating the time spent on \nexchanging goods and services.\nThe time spent trying to exchange goods or a service is called a \u201ctransaction cost.\u201d In \na barter economy, transaction costs are high because people have to satisfy a \u201cdouble \ncoincidence of wants\u201d\u2014they have to find someone who has a good or service they \nwant and who also wants the goods or services they have to offer.\nMoney is therefore a lubricant that allows the economy to run more smoothly by \nlowering transaction costs and encouraging specialization and the division of labour .\n 2\ufffd Money as a unit of account\nThe second role of money is to provide a unit of account. It is used to measure value \nin the economy. We measure the value of goods and services in terms of money. Just \nas we measure weight in terms of pounds or distance in terms of miles.\nImagine how hard it would be to shop in a supermarket with a thousand different items \non its shelves. To make sure that you can compare the prices of all items, the price tags \nof each item would have to list up to 999 different prices, and the time spent reading \nthem would result in a very high transaction cost.\nThe solution to the problem is to introduce money into the economy. Money units \nserve as a unit of measurement in terms of which the values of goods and services \nexchanged in the economy are measured and expressed. Money enables an orderly \n73"

A store of value is used to save purchasing power from the time income is \nreceived until it is spent. This function of money is useful because most of us do not \nwant to immediately spend our income on receiving it. We\u2019d rather prefer to wait until \nwe have the time or the desire to shop.\nMoney is not unique as a store of value; any asset, be it money, stocks, bonds, land, \nhouses, art, or jewellery, can be used to store wealth. Many such assets have an \nadvantage over money as a store of value: they often pay the owner a higher interest \nrate than money, maintain price value and provide service as a house. If these assets \nare more desirable stores of value than money, why do people hold money at all? The \nanswer to this question relates to the important economic concept of liquidity, or the \nrelative ease and speed with which an asset can be converted to a medium of exchange.\n4\ufffd Money as a standard of deferred payments\nMoney lets you buy now and pay later. Or it lets you lend now and collect later. When \npeople save money, that money can be borrowed and channeled into investments. \nIt is the deferred payment function of money that permits this transfer of spending \npower from earners\u2014savers to borrowers\u2014spenders. It permits the easy transfer of \nresources out of their less desired (less productive, less profitable) uses and into their \nmore desired (more productive, more profitable) uses.\n \u0102 Activity 6 \ufffd3\n1.

Let us analyse the \ndemand for and supply of money separately.\nDemand for Money\nThe old idea about the demand for money was that money was demanded to complete \nbusiness transactions. In other words, the demand for money depends on the volume \nof trade or transactions. As a result, demand for money increased during a boom period \nor when trade was erratic, and decreased during a depression or a lull in trade.\nThe modern idea about the demand for money was put forward by John Maynard \nKeynes, the famous English economist, who gave birth to what has been called the \nKeynesian Economics. According to Keynes, the demand for money, or liquidity \npreference, as he called it, means the demand for money to hold.\nPeople want money for three main reasons:\n(i) Transactional motivation          \n(ii) Precautionary motive         \n (iii) A speculative motivation\nEach one of them could be explained as follows.\n(i) Transaction purpose:\n    This motive can be looked at from the:\n(a) perspective of consumers seeking income to meet their household expenditures, \nalso known as the income motive, and\n(b) point of view of businessmen, who require money and want to hold it in order \nto carry on their business, i.e., the business motive.\n(a) Income motive:\nThe transaction motive relates to the demand for money or the need for cash for the \ncurrent transactions of individual and business exchanges. Individuals hold cash in \norder \u201cto bridge the interval between the receipt of income and its expenditure.\u201d This \nis called the \u201cincome motive.\u201d\nMost people receive their income by the week or the month, whereas the expenditure \nis on a day-to-day basis. A certain amount of money, therefore, is kept on hand to \nmake current payments. This amount will depend upon the size of the individual\u2019s \nincome, the interval at which the income is received, and the methods of payment \n75"

They need money all the \ntime in order to pay for raw materials and transport, pay wages and salaries, and meet \nall other current expenses incurred by any business.\nIt is clear that the amount of money held, under this business motive, will depend to \na very large extent on the turnover (i.e., the volume of trade of the firm in question). \nThe larger the turnover, the greater, in general, the amount of money needed to cover \ncurrent expenses.\n(ii) Precautionary motive: \nThe precautionary motive for holding money refers to the desire of people to hold \ncash balances for unforeseen contingencies. People hold a certain amount of money to \nprovide for the risk of unemployment, sickness, accidents, and other more uncertain \nlosses. The amount of money held under this motive will depend on the nature of the \nindividual and on the conditions in which he lives.\n(iii) Speculative motive:\nThe speculative motive relates to the desire to hold one\u2019s resources in liquid form in \norder to take advantage of market movements regarding future changes in the rate of \ninterest (or bond-prices). Money held under the speculative motive serves as a store \nof value, just as money held under the precautionary motive does. But it is a store of \nmoney meant for a different purpose.\nThus, the amount of money required to be held under the various motives constitutes \nthe demand for money.\nSupply of money\nJust as the demand for money is the demand for money to hold, similarly, the supply of \nmoney means the supply of money to hold. Money must always be held by someone, \notherwise it cannot exist. Hence, the supply of money means the sum total of all the \nforms of money held by a community at any given moment.\nThe money supply consists of (a) metallic money or coins, (b) currency notes issued by \nthe currency authority of the country, whether it be the central bank or the government, \nand chequable bank deposits.

            "text": "Unit 7: Introduction to Macroeconomics Types of inflation\nLet us understand how inflation originates or what causes it. Depending upon the \nspecific causes, two types of inflation have been distinguished: (1) Demand \u2013pull \ninflation (2) Cost-push inflation  \n yDemand-pull inflation results from an increase in aggregate demand when \nthe economy is producing at or near full capacity. This demand is growing \nfaster than the economy\u2019s productive capacity at full employment. This is \na situation where \u201ctoo much money\u201d chases \u201ctoo few goods.\u201d This is an \nexample of a situation in which the primary factor at work is an increase in \naggregate demand for output, whether from the government, entrepreneurs, \nor households. The result is that the pressure of demand is such that it cannot \nbe met by the currently available supply of output.\n yCost push, also known as supply-side inflation, occurs as a result of a \ncontinuous decline in aggregate supply. This may be due to bad weather, an \nincrease in wages, or the prices of other inputs. Setbacks in agricultural and \nindustrial production due to various reasons\u2014shortages of raw materials, \npower breakdowns, strikes and lockouts, bad weather conditions, increases in \ninput prices, etc.\u2014lead to a decreased supply of goods in comparison to their \ndemand, which further leads to price rises.\n2\ufffd Unemployment\nUnemployment is a term referring to individuals who are employable and actively \nseeking a job but are unable to find a job. Included in this group are those people in \nthe workforce who are working but do not have an appropriate job.\nInterestingly, people who have not looked for a job in the past four weeks but have \nbeen actively seeking one in the last 12 months are put into a category called the \n\u201cmarginally attached to the labor force.\u201d Within this category is another category \ncalled \u201cdiscouraged workers,\u201d which refers to people who have given up looking for \na job.\nThe labor force consists of all those who are fit for work and are willing and available \nto work. In other words, if we exclude children, old people, individuals who are \nunable to work, etc., from the population of a country, we get the number of those \nwho are able to work. We further deduct from this those who are not willing or are not \navailable to work. This gives us the labor force.\n87"

For example, if an agricultural graduate is looking for a job at \na construction site. Thus, unemployment that arises due to a change in the pattern \nof demand, leading to changes in the structure of production in the economy, is \ncalled \u201cstructural unemployment.\u201d Structural unemployment signifies a mismatch \nbetween the supply and demand for labor.\nc. Cyclical unemployment is generated due to the absence of vacancies. This usually \nhappens due to a deficiency in demand for commodities. Thus, unemployment that \narises due to inadequate overall demand associated with the downswing, recession, \nor depression period of a trade cycle is called \u201ccyclical unemployment.\u201d"

It occurs when productivity is low and too many workers are filling too few \njobs. It can refer to any part of the population that is not employed at full capacity .\nDisguised unemployment, or hidden unemployment, is an economic term used to \nrefer to the portion of the labor force that is involved in redundant work, which creates \nminimal to no productivity. Disguised unemployment is very common in third world \ncountries, which are still developing and have large populations. This is known as a \nlabor surplus.\n3. Trade Balance Deficit \nThe trade balance is sometimes referred to as the visible balance because it represents \nthe difference between receipts for exports of goods and expenditure on imports of \ngoods which can be visibly seen crossing frontiers. \nTrade Balance = Receipts for exported goods \u2013 Payments on imported goods\nWhen the trade balance is in surplus this means that a country has earned more from \nits exports of goods than while disequilibrium means that the condition is either deficit \nor surplus. \nA deficit in balance of trade occurs when the total receipts are exceeded by total \npayments; it has paid for its imports of goods. For example, the Ethiopian economy \nhas been experienced a deficit balance of trade as the national\u2019s export receipt is \nshortfalls of import expenditure. \n4. Balance of Payments Deficit\nThe balance of payments is a statistical record of all the economic transactions between \nresidents of the reporting country and residents of the rest of the world during a given \ntime period. The usual reporting period for all the statistics included in the accounts \nis a year. However, some of the statistics that make up the balance of payments are \npublished on a more regular monthly and quarterly basis. Without question the balance \nof payments is one of the most important statistical statements for any country .\nIt reveals how many goods and services the country has been exporting and importing, \nand whether the country has been borrowing from or lending money to the rest of \nthe world.  In addition, whether or not the central monetary authority (usually the \ncentral bank) has added to or reduced its reserves of foreign currency is reported in \nthe statistics. \n89"

It involves creating incremental \nwealth by bringing together resources in new ways to start and operate an enterprise. \nEntrepreneurship is a practice and a process that results in creativity, innovation and \nenterprise development and growth.

These are:\n1) the ability to spot a potentially profitable opportunity.\n2) the ability to commercialise the perceived opportunity, also referred to as \ninnovation\n3) the ability to pursue it in the long term.\n4) the ability to pursue it methodically.\n5) acceptance of failure as a possibility.  \nThe history of entrepreneurship\nDuring the ancient period, the word \u201centrepreneur\u201d was used to refer to a person \nmanaging large commercial projects through the resources provided to him. In the \n17th century, a person who had signed a contractual agreement with the government \nto provide stipulated products or services was considered an entrepreneur. In this case, \nthe contract price is fixed so that any profit or loss reflects the entrepreneur \u2019s effort.\nIn the 18th century, the first theory of an entrepreneur was developed by Richard \nCantillon, who said that an entrepreneur is a risk-taker. If we consider the merchants, \nfarmers, and professionals, they all operate at risk. For example, if the merchants buy \nproducts at a known price and sell them at an unknown price, this shows that they are \noperating at risk. The other development during the 18th century was the differentiation \nof the entrepreneurial role from the capital providing role.\nBut in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, an entrepreneur was viewed from an \neconomic perspective. An entrepreneur organises and operates an enterprise for \npersonal gain. The concept of an entrepreneur as an inventor was established in the \nmid-twentieth century.\nFrom the historical development of entrepreneurship, it is possible to see that the \nperception of the word \u201centrepreneur\u201d was developed from managing commercial \nprojects to the application of innovation in business ideas.\nWhat is social entrepreneurship?\nSocial entrepreneurship is attracting growing amounts of talent, money, and attention, \nbut along with its increasing popularity has come less certainty about what exactly a "

Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and to identify \nnew and different ways of looking at problems and opportunities. It is a process of \nassembling ideas by recombining elements already known but wrongly assumed \nto be unrelated to each other. This definition has three key elements that are worth \nconsidering:\n yCreativity is an ongoing process.\n yIdeas: creativity results in ideas that have potential value.\n yRecombining: the creative process is one of putting things together in unexpected \nways.\nIn order to be creative, you need to be able to view things in new ways from different \nperspectives. Thus, creativity is the development of original and potentially useful \nideas about products, practises, services, or procedures for an or ganisation.\nB\ufffd Innovation\nInnovation lies at the heart of the entrepreneurial process and is a means to the \nexploitation of opportunities. It is the implementation of a new idea at an individual, \ngroup, or organisational level.\nThere are four distinct types of innovation, namely,\n yAn invention is defined as the creation of a new product, service, or process.\n yExpansion is the growth of a product, service, or process.\n yDuplication is the replication of an already existing product, service, or \nprocess.\n ySynthesis: the combination of existing concepts and factors into a new \nformulation.\nC\ufffd From Creativity to Entrepreneurship\nCreativity  is the ability to develop new ideas and to discover new ways of looking \nat problems and opportunities. Innovation is the ability to apply creative solutions to \nthose problems and opportunities in order to improve people\u2019s lives or enrich society.\nCreativity leads to the generation of novel and innovative ways of doing business. \nExploring new niches and coming up with new ideas leads to efficiency, which \neventually gives an entrepreneur a competitive advantage."

The way \npeople think and their attitude towards the pursuit of their goals is an important tool \nthat enables them to undertake entrepreneurial activities.\nEntrepreneurs are innovators and creators who, due to their way of thinking and mind-\nset, give their business the best chance of surviving. Effectively, it means that they are \nbrave in the decisions they make. They will actively seek clients and take risks. Further, \nthey possess a range of other characteristics that help to make an entrepreneurial \nmindset so important. Not all entrepreneurs succeed in every business activity. A \nsuccessful entrepreneur fails at least once. What matters is how entrepreneurs learn \nfrom their failures and exploit them.\nKey attitudes every entrepreneur must have for a business project:  \n1\ufffd Passion\nEntrepreneurs should be passionate about their: ideas, goals, and companies. This \npassion is what drives them to do their business. Whatever drives an individual to try to \nsucceed is where his or her passion lies, and that passion is essential to entrepreneurial \nlife.\n2\ufffd Bravery \nEntrepreneurs are fearful that they will not succeed in the sense that a well-conceived \nidea cannot be executed. However, they do not let these fears of failure inhibit them. \nSince they are brave, they learn from their failures. They utilise their fear of failing \nto push them to work hard and strive to correct the mistakes that have caused them to \nfail. Thus, it is bravery that drives them to pursue successful businesses.\n99"

For an idea to be worth pursuing, we must first determine \nwhether it can be converted into an entrepreneurial opportunity. An entrepreneurial \nopportunity is the point at which identifiable consumer demand meets the possibility \nof satisfying the requested product or service. In the field of entrepreneurship, specific \ncriteria need to be met to move from an idea into an opportunity. It begins with \ndeveloping the right mindset\u2014a mindset where the aspiring entrepreneur sharpens his \nor her senses on consumer needs, and conducts research to determine whether the idea \ncan become a successful new project.\nIn some cases, opportunities are found through a deliberate search, especially when \ndeveloping new technologies. In other instances, opportunities emerge unintentionally \nby chance. In most cases, however, an entrepreneurial opportunity arises from \nrecognising a problem and making a concerted effort to solve it.\nIn the 20th century, economist Joseph Schumpeter stated that entrepreneurial innovation \nis the disruptive force that creates and sustains economic growth. But in the process, it \ncan also destroy established companies, reshape businesses, and interrupt employment. \nHe termed this force \u201ccreative destruction.\u201d Schumpeter described business processes, \nincluding the concept of reduction, as designed to increase company efficiency. The \nchange in business development in the economy improves our lifestyle, but it can \nmake other activities or products out-dated."

While \nthat is not essentially wrong, it can be very restricting. On the other hand, working \nwith a team offers different perspectives and ideas, which might end up bringing much \nbetter results.\nStudies have shown that teams with members coming from diverse backgrounds \n(gender, age, ethnicity, etc.) are more creative and perform better by up to 35 percent, \ncompared to non-diverse teams.

The \ndevelopment of new products can be costly, and capital may be required. Such \ndevelopments are financed internally, whereas the capital to purchase machinery may \ncome from external sources. In this case, many organisations have to look for short \nterm capital in the form of loans, working capital, etc., in order to provide finance.\nA\ufffd Budgetary Requirements\nAll businesses need money to finance different activities.

It is used to finance the start-up costs of an enterprise \nor major developments and expansions in its life cycle. It may be required for a \nsignificant innovation, such as a new product development. Ideally, permanent \ncapital is only repaired when the firm can afford it; investment in equity is re -\nwarded by dividends from profits, or a capital gain when shares are sold.  \n2\ufffd Working capital is a type of short-term financing. Most small firms need \nworking capital to pay for raw materials and cover other costs. Requirements \nfor this kind of short-term financing will vary considerably by business type. In \n105"

The process of setting up a business is known as \n\u201centrepreneurship.\u201d The entrepreneur is commonly seen as an innovator, a source of \nnew ideas, goods, services, and business or procedures. Entrepreneurship is a process, \nand the entrepreneur is the person undertaking entrepreneurial activity, such as starting \ntheir own business.\nSocial entrepreneurship hints at the imperative to drive social change, and it is that \npotential payoff that has its lasting and transformational benefit to society. Social \nentrepreneurship is the process by which individuals, start-ups, and entrepreneurs \ndevelop and find solutions that directly address social issues. A social entrepreneur, \ntherefore, is a person who explores business opportunities that have a positive impact \non their community, society, or the world.\nEntrepreneurs are business people who can detect and sense the availability of \nbusiness opportunities in any given scenario. They will then take advantage of these \nopportunities to develop new products by utilising new manufacturing methods in \nvarious markets.\nCreativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and to identify new and different \nways of looking at problems and opportunities. Essentially, creative entrepreneurs \nare investors in talent\u2014their own or other people\u2019s. The most renowned creative \nentrepreneurs have combined creative flair with entrepreneurial ability to build \nmultimillion-dollar business empires. Examples include Haile Gebrselassie (an \nEthiopian retired long-distance track and road running athlete).\nInnovation lies at the heart of the entrepreneurial process and is a means to the \nexploitation of opportunity. An innovation is a process by which a domain, a product, \nor a service is renewed and brought up to date by applying new processes, introducing \nnew techniques, or establishing successful ideas to create new value.\n "
