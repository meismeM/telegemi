The meaning of ethics  \nIn everyday language, the distinction between the terms \u2018ethics\u2019 and \u2018morality\u2019 is \nnot always clear.  Historically, the term \u2018ethics\u2019 comes from Greek \u2018ethos\u2019 which means the customs, habits and mores of people. Ethics is a discipline that deals with morality or it is a set of moral principles. From a theoretical or purely descriptive point of view, ethics is interested in the nature and origin of moral judgments. From a practical or prescriptive point of view, however, ethics is concerned with the particular norms, values or principles that ought to be used to arrive at proper moral judgments.

Judgments about such decisions are generally expressed \nwith words like right, and wrong, should and ought, and obligation and duty .\n Morality refers to the standards and principles used to determine the behaviors, decisions or actions of individuals as right or wrong, good or bad, acceptable or unacceptable. On the other hand, ethics is concerned with what is right or wrong, what is good or bad, or what is acceptable or not acceptable. Ethics is a human conduct and is applied in daily life to determine acceptable human behavior. It is concerned with what is good for individuals and society. Ethics impacts the behavior and demands an individual to take the right options. Managing life and acting responsibly is very hard without ethics.\nEthics also refers to those values and principles that oblige someone to refrain from \nunethical   acts such as rape, stealing, murder, assault, slander, and fraud. It includes the virtues of honesty, compassion, and loyalty and standards relating to rights, such as the right to life, the right to freedom from injury, and the right to privacy. Generally, ethics is a discipline that teaches us to follow the right way, to do the right thing and to refrain from bad or wrong doings.\nThere are three students called X, Y and Z who attend Grade 9, section \n\u2018A\u2019.  Student \u2018X\u2019 is very clever and ranks first from all sections. Student X and Z are sitting on the same bench in the class. From three of them, student Y and Z are best friends.

For example, it is common to help each other in time of wedding ceremony, traditional cooperative systems (Debo/Jigi), when someone gets birth, mourning, during natural and man-made disasters, when a person is seriously sick, when someone is in a difficult economic problems, etc. \nActivity 1.4\nGo to your community and identify whether there are concerns \nor special supports or not given to peoples with disabilities, street children, elders, women and peoples with HIV/AIDS   by the communities, government or NGOs. Then, present your findings to the class with the facilitation of your teacher. Your activity work shall focus on the following questions:\n1. What kinds of concerns or support given to them and what do \nyou learn from that?\n2. If there is not any concern for these peoples from concerned bodies, what kinds of possible solutions do you suggest?"

It is a well-known moral value \nin our families, communities and the school. For instance, we have the culture of showing respect to our parents, elders, teachers, friends, neighbors and significant others. Respect is having positive feelings toward a person or treating a person with dignity regardless of ethnicity, religion, language, color, sex, economic background, disability and age (being a child or an adult). Thus, we have to respect each other for the mere reason that we are being human not for any other reason.\nFigure 1.2:     Respecting each other\nWe can be respectful to the people, things and places in the following ways.\n\u2022 Using kind or polite words even when we are upset;\n\u2022 Using manners like sharing, waiting our turn, saying please and thank you;\n\u2022 Accepting difference or at least disagreeing with kind words;\n\u2022 Being careful not to damage places or things;\n"

Rules are prescribed standards, or guides, for our conduct in a society or in an organization, like school. Rules are principles and they help us to follow basic values and principles. For instance, we have the duty not to steal, not to cheat exams, not to commit corruption, and to respect the well-being of fellow citizens in our society. If we violate these rules, we will be punished, face condemnations and exclusion from the society. \nLaws and regulations, on the other hand, are written standards of action endorsed \nby authority. They are binding and you will be punished if you break them. For example, your school has its own rules and regulations which are considered the laws of the school. As a result, wearing school uniform, respecting teachers, being punctual, not cheating exams, etc. are some of the standards we need to respect. So, if you fail to respect these rules, you will be punished. \nActivity 1.5\nDo the following questions in groups and reflect your discussion \nresults to the class.\n1.

For instance, we can promote the untold facts of our culture such as language, way of life, cultural dressing, cultural food, arts, historical tourism sites, holiday celebrities, etc to other societies and across the world through social media platforms.\nHowever, digital technologies have not only positive impacts on one\u2019s own culture. \nIt has serious negative impacts against one\u2019s own culture if they are not used appropriately and in responsible manner. Accordingly, using such technologies in a way deviated from our norms or moral values and principles can lead to the cultural diffusion and destruction of  indigenous values and norms of a particular society. For example, as you can understand from figure 2.2. below, inappropriate use of digital technology can affect family relationships. Both husband and wife are too busy in using their social media on their food and by ignoring their child.\nThus, our digital culture must be in line with the existing moral, social, and cultural \nvalues of the society in contemporary digital age."

Some of the major contributions of constitutionalism are discussed as follows:\nRealizations of human rights of citizens: Human rights are inviolable and \ninalienable rights. Constitutionalism prevents tyranny and guarantees the liberty and rights of individuals or groups of individuals. Respecting human rights and fundamental freedoms for all is the responsibility of every citizen and the government in particular.

It used \ntraditional or unwritten constitutions until the introduction of the first written constitution by Emperor Haile Selassie I in 1931.\n3.3.1.     Traditional constitutional experiences of Ethiopia\nUntil the early 1930s, the rule of the Ethiopian Emperors was based on traditional constitutions such as Kibre Negest, Fetha Negest and Sirate Mengist. The traditional constitutional experience was characterized by the dominance of myths and legends that were used to provide legitimacy to the monarchs rather than ensuring the basic rights and freedoms of citizens. The Kibre Negest (Glory of kings), justifies that the Ethiopian monarchs derived their power to rule from God. The Fetha Negest (Law of Kings) justifies the authority of kings and their officials. According to Fetha Negest, challenging the authority of the king is considered as challenging or rebelling against one\u2019s creator - God. Sirate Mengist is the other important document that emerged in the 19\nthc that proved to be administratives and protocol directive of the government.  \n3.3.2.     Written constitutional experiences in Ethiopia\ni.     The 1931 written constitution \nIn Ethiopia the first written constitution was introduced in 1931. On July 16 1931 a few months after his coronation, Emperor Haile Silassie I granted to the people of Ethiopia the first written constitution in the history of Ethiopia. The Emperor was motivated to introduce his first written constitution mainly for two reasons. The first one was the Emperor\u2019s high aspiration to show Ethiopia as a modern or civilized state to the external world. The second reason was, to consolidate emperor\u2019s absolute power over local nobilities through a formal constitutional framework. This constitution has 7 chapters and 55 articles.  Thus, the principal aim of the constitution was to consolidate the power of the king, not to lay foundations for the fundamental rights and dignity of citizens.\nii.     The Revised Constitution of 1955\nTwenty years later after the adoption of the first constitution, the imperial regime revised its constitution in 1955 mainly for two reasons: internal and external. The internal reason was the Italian invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. Accordingly, the 1931 "

The 1987 Constitution of the People\u2019s Democratic \nRepublic of Ethiopia (PDRE) \nIn 1974, the feudal monarchy or the Imperial Regime was removed from power \nby the Derg military regime. The Derg regime introduced different decrees and proclamations which had not constitutional status until the adoption of the 1987 constitution. Thus, the period from 1974 up to 1987 was known as constitutional vacuum or lacuna in Ethiopian political history. \nIn 1987 the government adopted its own constitution. This constitution has 7 \nchapters and 119 articles. The constitution changed the system of government from the monarchy system to a republican form of government. The 1987 PDRE constitution also introduced the idea of secularism or the separation of state and religion for the first time in Ethiopia.

Proper understanding of what constitutes society helps us to respect and value the cultural diversity in a multicultural society. \nIn Ethiopia, there are various peoples, with varieties of cultures and cultural practices, \nand this gives beauty and attraction to our society. For instance, if we see the Ethiopian coffee drinking cultures and ceremonies in different parts of the country, it is what we have to be proud of and make it maintained by the new generation. \nTherefore, learning about cultures helps us to recognize cultural differences and \navoid negative stereotypes and personal biases toward other societies\u2019 cultures.

Accepting difference means understanding how we are alike, how we are different and treating everyone with respect and understanding regardless of the differences. When we come across differences in our community, we need to accept that difference positively and respect the differences rather than discrediting and devaluing them based on our own standards. If differences are accepted and respected, they help to create peaceful coexistence and harmonious relationships among the members of the society.

Respecting differences\nMulticultural societies are characterized by existence of cultural, ethnic and religious diversities. Respect means different things to different people depending on the very things that make each person different, including culture, background or any other dimensions of diversity. There are distinctions among the peoples\u2019 in gender, culture, religion, ethnicity and socioeconomic background.

When we respect the religions of others, it means that we respect their culture.  This enables us to live in harmony as citizens of one country. Religious diversity is one of the common features indicating existence of diverse religions and belief systems in the society. Religious diversity is the fact that there are significant differences in religious beliefs and practices. Ethiopia is a country of religious diversity known as the land of peace and religious tolerance.  Therefore, in Ethiopia there is tolerance and respect of religious diversity in general. In the country both Christians and Muslims, churches and mosques are often situated within close proximity and relationships are peaceful. In addition to this, there are indigenous religions and belief systems practiced in some parts of the country.\n3) Linguistic diversity\nLanguage diversity, or linguistic diversity, is the existence of different languages in a given country. If the people of a particular society interact with others by making use of a variety of languages, the society can be said to have linguistic diversity. Linguistic diversity gives extra attraction to such societies; as such societies possess different kinds of literary writings and linguistic symbols. More over language is one of the most important aspects of culture and a society in which people speaks different languages can promote different cultural entities.  "

In forging unity in diversity in multicultural societies the most important thing is the balance between diversity and unity within one country . \nA balance between unity and diversity is used to create national integration and common national unity and identity among all nations, we have to recognize and respect differences in language, religious, identity, cultural values and historical background. This means to ensure the state national unity and common identity those differences must be respected and recognized. \nNow-a-day appreciation and recognition of diversity is understood not only as a \nsolution to challenges related to diversity but also used as an alternative means to achieve national integration in diversified societies.  National unity involves awareness of common identity and national feeling among the citizens of the country for national unity and national integrity. Here, for effective national integration and unity in diversity, although they have different religions and speak different languages they must recognize and believe that they are all one. When feelings of unity and harmony are in the hearts of the peoples a sense of common citizenship or feeling of loyalty to the nation will be fostered among the citizens of the state. \nBalancing national unity and diversity in Ethiopia is a very important task. Our \npopulation is characterized by a complex pattern of ethnic, linguistic and religious groups and these aspects of diversity are considered significant distinguishing features of the country.\nTherefore, to effectively maintaining Ethiopian national unity out of diverse ethnic \nidentities, religion, cultures, and socio-political differences, the need to balance between \u2018unity and diversity\u2019 is very critical issue.

Effective problem-solving involves several skills within the problem-solving process, and each career may require specific problem-solving skills. We solve problems every day without really thinking about how we solve them using experience and indigenous knowledge and skills. This skill is considered to be a soft skill, or an individual strength, as opposed to a learned hard skill. This means everybody may have this skill without having formal education and training in different degrees of application. \nThere are various indigenous problem-solving skills in every society that are used \nto resolve different problems people face in their life.  In this regard we have ample social skills that are used to resolve our social and individual problems in our individual and collective life. These problem-solving skills include negotiation skill, cooperative or collaborative skill, diversity tolerance skill and others. In addition to this, there are also many soft skills we have gained from our life experiences. Integrating these indigenous skills with scientific ones is very important in the problem-solving process. \nActivity 7.1\n \u2611Assume that one morning you find it raining, but you have to go \nto the school.

Stages of problem-solving processes\nProblem solving is the process of identifying a problem, developing possible \nsolution paths, and taking the appropriate course of action. To solve any problem effectively and become good problem solver, we have to pass through certain steps in the problem-solving process. Good problem solvers are people who properly follow these steps and respond to the issue in each step accordingly.  This is what we call stages of problem solving. They need to be considered in any problem-solving process. To solve or clarify any problem, there are many systematic methods and ways which we call as a process of problem-solving. Problem solving requires a methodical step-by-step approach to a challenge. \nFigure 7.3:    Stages of problem solving\nHere are some basic stages of problem-solving we can follow when approaching a problem in our personal life.\nStep 1: Define the Problem\n\u2022 The first step for you will be to define the problem. Then try to identify the \nroots causes or sources of the problem and the nature of the problem by asking questions and looking at the problems from different angles. It is very important to understand the problems and the challenges you would face while addressing them. Once you clearly understand the problem, you find the right solutions for that problem by using your problem-solving skills.\n"

The best way to gather information is by asking questions to those who are connected or related to the problem or situation. This is one of the most important stages of problem-solving that requires a careful balance of creativity and logical thinking. \nStep 3: Decide on the solution\n\u2022 Strong decision-making is essential at this stage. After carefully considering all options, you must select the best strategy for the problem and stick to your choice. After you have identified the problem and collected information, the next step for you is to organize all the collected information and then analyze it. While you do your analysis, try to build links and relationships in order of better understand the problem. Once you have done the proper analysis, breaking down the big problem into smaller pieces, it will help you find different solutions to it.\nStep 4: Implement the Solution\n\u2022 Implementation is the critical peak of the problem-solving process. This is where you draw up an action plan, share it with the appropriate personnel, and follow through with chosen approach. When you have chosen the best solution according to your requirements, and you are committed to that particular solution, now it\u2019s time to put it into action. Implementation of the solution is a key to get the best possible outcome, and hence this process needs careful attention. Sometimes, even the best solution could fail because of ineffective implementation. So, it is necessary to implement the plan most efficiently in order to avoid unforeseen problems. After you have completed the above steps, you just need to use your critical thinking ability and analytical thinking ability to create logical links between different potential solutions.  "

Effective problem-solving involves several skills within the problem-solving category, and each career may require specific problem-solving skills. Problem solving requires people to think critically and creatively. What is critical thinking? What is creative thinking? \n1. Critical thinking for problem solving\nCritical thinking can be described as the ability to engage in reflective and independent thinking. It is the ability to think clearly and rationally, understanding the logical connection between ideas. Critical thinking skills enable you to analyze information and process it rationally to help you determine the value of that information or make a decision. Good critical thinkers focus on facts, and on the scientific evaluation of the information at hand. \nMoral integrity, ethical consideration and action, and global citizenship practices are \nall symbols of effective critical thinkers. Critical thinking is important to be open-minded and critical analysis to be and being fair and reasonable. Critical thinking is the process to rationally analyze and attempt to solve a problem accurately and efficiently. \n2. Creative thinking for problem solving \nEffective critical thinkers are also largely creative thinkers. Creative thinkers are one who think \u2018outside the box\u2019. When solving problems, creativity can help to think of new methods, approaches and solutions for the problem.

The difference between critical thinkers and creative thinkers is that creativity is associated with generating ideas, while critical thinking is associated with analyzing and evaluating those ideas. Creative problem solving involves the ability to think critically and rationally to easily overcome the problem we encountered independently.\n7.4.2.      Problem solving skill as attributes of good citizens\nProblem solving involves using available information to identify and design solutions to problems. Our capacity to develop solutions to problems defines our ability to have good problem-solving skills. This involves our soft social skills that help us to become competent and responsible citizen for our actions and decisions in our day-to-day life. Thus, a good problem solver must have attributes of good citizen and a problem solver must show this disposition.  \nGood citizens are ones who display various social and problem solving skill. Problem \nsolving skill is one of the most important qualities of good citizens. Problem solving skills are used to be applied to resolve different interpersonal problems in the conflict management and resolution processes. Moreover, good attributes of citizen involve social skills that helps to improve individuals\u2019 problem solving skills which good citizens are expected to exercise in their daily life. The primary attributes of good citizens that help to improve problem solving skills are conflict resolution and critical thinking skills.\nI. Conflict resolution skills\nWithin relationships conflicts are inevitable, learning to deal with them in a healthy way is crucial. When conflict is mismanaged, it can harm the relationship. But when it is handled in a respectful and positive way, conflict provides an opportunity for growth, ultimately strengthening the bond between the parties. Successful conflict resolution depends on:\n\u25aa The capacity to recognize and respond to important matters \n\u25aa The readiness to forgive and forget\n\u25aa The ability to seek compromise and avoid punishing\n\u25aa The belief that resolution can support the interests and needs of both parties"

            "text": "150\nCitizenship Education Grade 9 Student TextbookThe famous Greek Philosopher Aristotle, describes the natural behavior of human \nbeing as saying \u201cman is a social animal\u201d. Human beings cannot live in isolation from other fellow beings. Human beings fulfill and satisfy their basic needs in association with others because; no one is self-sufficient in himself /herself in life.  Just as a human being cannot survive in isolation from others, no state can exist or sustain in isolation from others states. So, it is a must for a particular state to have strong relationships with other states in order to fulfill or ensure its national interests. This is called foreign relations.\nForeign relation is defined as the external relations of a country with countries \nof the world.  Ethiopia has long history of foreign relations with other countries mainly to protect its national interests and respect for its sovereignty. Regarding this, country\u2019s principles for external relations are sated under Article 86 of the 1995 FDRE constitution. According to this article of the constitution, Ethiopia\u2019s foreign relations shall be based on the protection of the national interests of the country and ensuring its sovereignty. In addition to this, the constitution states that foreign relations of the country are based on mutual benefits and equality of the states, observance of international agreements and   non-interference in the internal affairs of other states.  Furthermore, Ethiopia\u2019s foreign policy emphasizes on promoting mutual economic development and peaceful co-existence and strong public relations with its neighbors and other African states.\n8.1.1.      National interest\nNational interest is a key concept in foreign relations. It refers to goals, claims, demands which states always seek to achieve, preserve and secure in relations with other nations. Every state attempts to achieve or secure its different national interests, for example, political, socio-economic, cultural and security interests.   National interest can also be understood as survival of a state. It is the protection of the sovereignty of the state from external interventions or aggressions. Securing its national interest is all about a universally accepted right of each state. Thus, the behavior and activities of a state is always governed by its national interests. \nAll states devise and continuously search for national security, political independence \nand territorial integrity. Maintaining or preserving both domestic and external security is among the most priority issues of the national interest of a given state.  The absence of peace and security in one state can be a threat to the security of another "

For instance, in the Horn of Africa, the longtime  security crises in neighboring \nstate Somalia has been a case of concern for Ethiopia and the globe. On the other hand, the achievement or success of the socio-economic development of one state depends on that of another. A good example for this is Ethio-Djibouti relationships. Almost 90 per cent of Ethiopia\u2019s imports arrive via the port of Djibouti.  \n8.1.2.      Foreign policy\nStates can realize their foreign relations through their foreign policies. Foreign  policies  are  the  agreements,  strategies,  methods and  guidelines  that states usually    use  to  accomplish  their  actions  in  the  international  arena.  Foreign policy is the most important element by which states are able to convert their broadly conceived goals and interest into concrete reality. A particular state needs to formulate its foreign policies mainly to protect its national security, core values and interest, ideological goals and economic development.    \nGenerally, the main aim of foreign policy of a given state is to accomplish its national \ninterest and maintain its national ideology. All states are subject to the influence of the decisions and actions of other nations. A state without a foreign policy, compared with a ship in the deep sea without any knowledge of directions. Thus, foreign policy leads a state in fulfilling its national interests and acquiring rightful place in the international arena."

It seeks, by the \nuse of reason, conciliation and the exchange of interests, to prevent major conflicts arising between sovereign states.\nEconomic methods  \nEconomic development is among the core instruments of the foreign policy of states. Economically all states across the world are not at the same level or status. In terms of the level of economic development, there are well developed nations such as the United States of America, European states, China, Japan, India and others. On the other hand, there are least developed nations like many African states including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Djibouti, Sudan, Kenya, South Sudan, etc.  Since all states are economically at various level of development they depend on each other to meet their national economic interests. The economic instrument of foreign policy, thus arises from this fact. \nMilitary Force\nSometimes states do not accomplish their foreign policy objectives only through diplomacy or dialogue and negotiations. The foreign relationships conducted between or among states can go beyond diplomatic deal and finally lead to conflicts. This means that; states use this instrument when their national interests are not fulfilled by peaceful methods. During this time, states use military interventions as the last resort. In order to realize foreign policy through military power, the strength of  a particular state matters, because states with highly advanced and latest military technologies, for instance  USA, Russia, China and others have a great bargaining power over other states in the international arena. This foreign policy instrument is more of violent and follows imposition of force on other countries. "

The roles of foreign policy in enhancing the \nregional cooperation\nEast Africa, particularly the Horn of Africa has been known for its recurrent civil \nwars and border disputes in its history. However, this does not mean that the East African states do not have foreign relationships with one another. Rather, states in the Horn of Africa such as Ethiopia, Kenya, Eritrea, Sudan, Djibouti, Somalia, South Sudan and Uganda have a long standing links with each other in areas of language, culture, history, natural resources, and so on.\nIn addition to this, there are cross Boundary Rivers that connect Ethiopia with its \nneighboring states.  Such rivers can determine a special type of relation between the countries that these rivers cross. The Blue Nile, Tekeze, Aqobo and Baro flow to Sudan and Egypt. Wabishebelle, Genale and Dawa rivers flow to Somalia and Omo River flows to Kenya. These rivers have significant contributions in the development endeavors of all states and  their fair utilization is a great security concern among them. For instance, there has been a serious disagreement between Ethiopia, Sudan and Egypt on the construction of Grand Renaissance Dam by Ethiopia on Abay River. Thus, these countries will have to negotiate and make agreements in how to use these rivers equitably. \nOn the other hand, Ethiopia is the largest country without port in the Horn of Africa. \nAs a result, it needs to create strong regional cooperation with neighboring states by formulating appropriate foreign policies. One of the key regional institution through which Ethiopia realizes its regional foreign policy is  Intergovernmental Authority for Development (IGAD). This regional organization is very important to promote peace and security through economic integration in East Africa.\nGenerally, regional cooperation has great impacts in the daily life of the people. It \nhelps to solve cross- border disputes among states and speed up socio-economic transformations of states. Accordingly, Ethiopia has to look regional foreign policy as a podium to realize its two major national interests. The first one is ensuring peace and security, whereas the second one is socio-economic transformations."

For a long time East Africa, particularly the Horn of Africa has witnessed civil wars between states and also terrorist attacks by Al-Shabaab.  \nEthiopia is referred to be a regional power in the Horn of Africa, owing to its \nmilitary and diplomatic influence as well as its population size.  Ethiopia\u2019s growing involvement in regional peace and security concerns demonstrates the country\u2019s determination to lead and influence the area. Thus, Ethiopia in terms of its strategic location and one of the regional powers needs to cooperate with regional states  for the establishment of a peaceful, integrated and prosperous region. \n"

The roles of foreign policy for socio-economic \ndevelopment of Ethiopia\nEast African states are the least developed in terms of socio-economic development. \nExcept Ethiopia, South Sudan and Uganda, all of these countries have ports. The provision of port services benefits both the service supplier and the service recipient. In fact, if Ethiopia\u2019s neighbors do not supply port services, its economic consequences will be severe. For instance the  port of Djibouti was designed from the start to serve Ethiopia, given its proximity to Djibouti. This has great contributions for rapid socio-economic development of the country. \nSimilarly, Ethiopia is a provider of  major market for Djibouti as compared to other \nneigboring states. Thus, the port of Djibouti is the bedrock for the socio-economic  relationships of the two states. In addition to this,Ethiopia  saves millions of dollars each year by importing oil from neighboring Sudan.  Ethiopia also  exports electric power to Djibouti, Sudan and Kenya. This  regional power pool of the country  intends to raise its export profits while also boosting the  economic growth of  electricity-importing countries. Therefore, Ethiopia has been playing a great role in promoting the economic cooperation in the region through its foreign policy .\n"
