How can you\nclassify physical\nquantities?Introduction\nPhysics begins with observations of phenomena, events, matter or energy.\nThrough demanding and controlled experimentation and logical thought\nprocess, the physical phenomena are described quantitatively using mathe-\nmatical tools. Any quantitative description of a property requires compari-\nson with a scale of different measuring devises. For example, length needs\na meter-stick, time needs a watch, and mass needs a beam balance. In this\nprocess, we recognize a very obvious fact that properties of different kinds\ncannot be compared. You cannot compare the time of travel from point A to\nB with the distance between the two points, although the two quantities may\nbe related. The time of travel (time) is a physical quantity and the distance\n(length) is also a physical quantity. They are completely different types of\nphysical quantities measured by different measuring devices and units. In\nthis unit you will learn different types of scales, measurement, classification\nof physical quantities, and conversion from one system of units to another.\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n\u2022know physical quantities.\n\u2022measure different physical quantities with accuracy.\n\u2022appreciate the measurement activities of different physical quantities.\n11"

These are nominal scales,\nordinal scales, interval scales and ratio scales.\nExercise 2.1\nList different ex-\namples of ordinal\nscales.\u2022Nominal scales: are used for labeling variables without any number value.\nFor nominal scales there is no inherent quantitative difference among the\ncategories. Examples are: gender (male, female), hair color (black, brown).\nExercise 2.2\nList different ex-\namples of interval\nscales.\u2022Ordinal scales: are rank-order observations. For this type of scale, there is\nan underlying quantitative measurement on which the observations differ.\nExample: Your class rank in the previous grades.\nKey Concept:\nTIn physics scale\nis a set of numbers,\namounts, etc., used\nto measure or com-\npare the level of\nsomething.\nTRatio scale is\nan advanced scale\nin which addition,\nsubtraction, multipli-\ncation and division is\npossible.\u2022Interval scales: have a constant interval but lack a true zero point. For this\ntype of scale, one can add and subtract values on an interval scale, but one\ncannot multiply or divide units. Temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit scale\nis an example of interval scale.\n\u2022Ratio scales: have the property of equal intervals but also have a true zero\npoint. As a result, one can multiply and divide as well as add and subtract\nusing ratio scales. Units of time (second, minute, hour), length (centimeter,\nmeter, kilometer), weight (milligram, gram, kilogram), volume (centimeter\ncube) and temperature in Kelvin Scale are ratio scales.\nNote that even though a ratio scale has a true zero point, the nature of the\nvariable is such that a value of zero will never be observed. For example human\nheight is measured on a ratio scale but every human has a height greater than\nzero."

All other\nquantities in physics can be derived from these seven basic or fundamental\nphysical quantities.\nTable 2.1 Measurement of mass at different places.\nNo. Name of student Place Measured value\n1 Student A Location A 1.6 unit\n2 Student B Location B 2.1 unit\n3 Student C Location C 2.5 unit\n4 Student D Location D 3.0 unit\n5 Student E Location E 1.1 unit\n6 Student F Location F 3.5 unit\nActivity 2.3\nTSix grade 9 stu-\ndents in different\nparts of Ethiopia\nare given the same\nobject and mea-\nsured its mass in\nthe same unit as\nshown in Table 2.1.\nDiscuss whether the\nmeasurement has a\nstandard or not re-\ngardless of personal\nerrors.If your teacher orders you to report the results of a measurement to someone who\nwishes to reproduce this measurement, a standard must be defined.

If n > 0 it represents\nhow many times the decimal place in d should be moved to the right. If n < 0,\nthen it represents how many times the decimal place in d should be moved to the\nleft. For example, 3 .24\u00d7103represents 3240 (the decimal moved three places to\nthe right) and 3 .24\u00d710\u22123presents 0.00324 (the decimal moved three places to\nthe left).\nSignificant Figures\nIn a number, each non-zero digit is a significant figure. Zeroes are only counted\nif they are between two non-zero digits or are at the end of the decimal part.\nFor example, the number 2000 has 1 significant figure (the 2), but 2000.0 has 5\nsignificant figures. You estimate a number like this by removing significant figures\nfrom the number (starting from the right) until you have the desired number\nof significant figures, rounding as you go. For example, 6.827 has 4 significant\nfigures, but if you wish to write it to 3 significant figures it would mean removing\nthe 7 and rounding up, so it would be 6.83.\nExercise 2.5\nWrite the physical\nquantities in Table\n2.2 using appropri-\nate prefixes.\nTThe radius of the\nearth is 6,371,000 m\nTThe diameter\nof our hair is 0.000\n0075 mPrefixes\nIn the previous section you have learned different basic units. When a numerical\nunit is either very small or very large, the units used to define its size may be\nmodified by using a prefix. A prefix is an important aspect of dealing with units.\nPrefixes are words or letters written in front that change the meaning. Table 2.2\nlists a large set of these prefixes. The kilogram (kg) is a simple example. 1 kg is\n1000 g, or 1 \u00d7103g. We can replace the 103with the prefix k (kilo)."

We encounter\nmotion in our day-to-day activities and have enough experience about it. You\nmight have learnt in lower grades that everything in the universe moves. It is\nbecause of this that motion is one of the key topics in physics. We use the basic\nconcepts of distance, displacement, speed, velocity and acceleration to express\nmotion. There are different types of motions. Motion in a straight line is one of\nthe simplest forms of motion in a specific direction. The motions of a car on a\nroad, the motion of a train along a straight railway track or an object falling freely\nare examples of one-dimensional motion.\nAt the end of this unit, you should be able to:\n\u2022describe motion in terms of frame of reference, displacement, speed, ve-\nlocity, and acceleration;\n\u2022draw diagrams to locate objects with respect to a reference;\n\u2022solve problems involving distance, displacement, speed, velocity and\nacceleration;\n\u2022make practical measurements of distance, displacement, average speed,\naverage velocity and acceleration.\n35"

When you go to\nschool, your journey begins from your home. Your home is your original position.\nAfter some time, you will reach your school. Your school is your final position.\nIn this process, you are continuously changing your position. While traveling\nfrom home to school, you are increasing the gap between your present position\nand your home. This continuous change of position is known as motion. Note\nthat your change of position is observed by considering the distance from your\nschool to home. Your home is taken as a reference frame . Motion is a continuous\nchange in position of an object relative to the position of a fixed object called\nreference frame.\nKey Concept:\nTA frame of reference is a set of coordinates that can be used to deter-\nmine positions of objects.\nTMotion is the change in the position of the object with respect to a fixed\npoint as the time passes.\nA body is said to be at rest in a frame of reference when its position in that\nreference frame does not change with time. If the position of a body changes\nwith time in a frame of reference, the body is said to be in motion in that frame of\nreference. The concepts of rest and motion are completely relative; a body at rest\nin one reference frame may be in motion with respect to another reference frame.\nFor example, if you are 2 m from the doorway inside your classroom, then your\nreference point is the doorway. Your classroom can be used as a reference frame.\nIn the classroom, the walls are not moving, and can be used as a fixed frame of\nreference. We commonly use the origin as a fixed reference point to describe\nmotion along a straight line."

For example, if a runner\ntravelling at 10 km/h due east slows to a stop, reverses direction, and continues\nher run at 10 km/h due west, her velocity has changed as a result of the change in\ndirection, although the magnitude of the velocity is the same in both directions.\nAcceleration occurs when velocity changes in magnitude (an increase or decrease\nin speed) or in direction, or both as shown in Figure. 3.6. Acceleration is, therefore,\na change in speed or direction, or both.\nKey Concept:\nTAcceleration is the rate of change of velocity.\nIf the initial velocity of a body is viat a time ti, and the final velocity is vfat a\ntime tf, the average acceleration is, from the definition,"

Any time the state of motion of an object changes, a force has been\napplied. Force can cause a stationary object to start moving or a moving object\nto accelerate. You exert force to stretch or compress a spring, to throw or kick a\nball, to pick your books from a table, to fetch water from a river or well etc. In\nmechanics, a force is a push or a pull exerted on a body that changes the state of\nmotion of the body. That means force can change the velocity of a body or cause\ndeformation by changing its shape or size. The push or pull on an object can\nvary considerably in either magnitude or direction. Because a force is determined\nby both a magnitude and a direction, it is a vector quantity. Forces, like other\nvectors, are represented by arrows and can be added using the familiar head-to-\ntail method or trigonometric methods. Examples of forces include friction force,\nnormal force, and the force of gravity.\nActivity 4.1\nCan a force always\ncause motion? Dis-\ncuss in groups and\nwith your teacher.Contact and Non-Contact Forces\nIn each of the situations depicted in Figure 4.1, forces are acting. Some are applied\ndirectly to an object and some act on a body without touching it. Forces that\ninvolve physical contact between objects are called contact forces, because the\nbodies will experience the force while contact is maintained. However, forces that\ndo not involve physical contact between objects are know as non-contact forces.\nContact forces are the easiest to understand and include the simple push and\npull that are experienced daily in people\u2019s lives. Applied forces, normal forces,\nfrictional forces, and spring forces are the types of contact forces.\nYou might have already an experience that when you bring a piece of iron\nclose to a magnet, but without touching it, the piece of iron will be attracted to\nthe magnet. This magnetic force is one common example of non-contact force.\nAnother example of a non-contact force is the gravitational force between an\nobject and the earth. If you throw the object vertically upwards, it falls back to\nearth because of this force."

If the car comes to a sudden stop,\nyour body tends to keep moving forward. However, when the car starts\nmoving again, your body tends to move backward. What do you think is\nthe reason? Discuss in groups.\nNewton\u2019s first law of motion is sometimes called the law of inertia. It states that a\nbody continues to be in its state of rest or of uniform motion in a straight line un-\nless it is acted on by unbalanced force. Newton\u2019s first law of motion explains how\ninertia affects moving and non-moving objects. Inertia is a property of matter\nby which it continues in its existing state of rest or uniform motion in a straight\nline, unless that state is changed by an external force. In other words inertia is the\ntendency of an object to resist any attempt to change its velocity.\nLook at the pool balls in Figure 4.4. When a pool player pushes the pool stick\nagainst the white ball, the white ball is set into motion. Once the white ball is\nrolling, it rolls all the way across the table and stops moving only after it crashes\ninto the cluster of colored balls. Then, the force of the collision starts the colored\nballs moving. Some may roll until they bounce off the raised sides of the table.\nSome may fall down into the holes at the edges of the table. None of these motions\nwill occur, however, unless that initial push of the pool stick is applied.\nNewton\u2019s first law of motion defines a special set of reference frames called inertial\nframes. An inertial frame is defined as one in which Newton\u2019s first law of motion\n(also called the law of inertia) is valid. Such a reference frame is called an inertial\nframe of reference. If an object does not interact with other objects, it has zero\nacceleration in an inertial frame of reference. Any reference frame that moves"

From such observations, we conclude that the acceleration of\nan object is directly proportional to the force acting on it. Consider the example\nof a batter, like the man in Figure 4.5. The harder he hits the ball, the greater will\nbe its acceleration. It will travel faster and farther if he hits it with more force.\nFigure 4.5 Hitting a baseball with\ngreater force gives it greater accel-\neration.Activity 4.6\nTTake two different wooden (or metal) blocks of different masses and\nplace them on a smooth horizontal surface.

The acceleration due to gravity is denoted by \u2019g\u2019 and has a constant\nvalue of 9 .8m/s2on the surface of the earth and is directed towards the center of\nthe earth.\nHence, applying Newton\u2019s second law, the magnitude of the gravitational\nforce on an object is given by:\nFg=mg (4.3)\nThis force is directed towards the center of the earth.

If you push the wall harder, the wall pushes you\nback with larger force and you may feel pain in your hand. This simple activity\nillustrates an important general principle known as Newton\u2019s third law of motion.\nIn fact, the force with which you push the car is equal in magnitude but opposite\nin direction to the force with which the car pushes you back as shown in Figure\n4.6. In general, if F12is the force exerted by object 1 on object 2 and F21is the\nforce exerted by object 2 on object 1, then,\nKey Concept:\nThe action and reac-\ntion forces are equal\nin magnitude but\nopposite in direc-\ntion and they act on\ndifferent objects.F12= \u2212F21 (4.5)\nThat means F12is equal in magnitude but opposite in direction to F21.F12is\ncalled action force and F21is called reaction force, though either force can be\nlabeled the action or reaction force.\nConsider a block of mass m placed on a horizontal table (Fig.4.7 ). What are the\naction and reaction forces?\nFigure 4.7 Action and reaction\nforces for a block placed on a hori-\nzontal table.The action and reaction forces are represented by F12and F21. Let F12 be the\nforce that the block exerts on the table. This force is equal to the weight of the\nblock. F12is directed vertically downwards as shown in the figure. On the other\nhand, the table exerts a force F21on the block. F21is directed vertically upwards,\nbut has the same magnitude as F12.F21is also called normal force. However, it\nhas to be noted that taking F21as action force and F12as reaction force is also\npossible. Newton\u2019s third law of motion states that every action has an equal and\nopposite reaction. This means that forces always act in pairs."

Is it\npossible to multiply\nenergy? How can we\nmultiply a force or a\nspeed?Imagine trying to put a staple through a stack of paper with your bare hands! It\nis an almost impossible and dangerous task. A stapler gets the job done quickly,\neasily, and safely. A simple machine is a device that requires a single force to do\nmechanical work. The stapler works by applying a single downward force at its\nopen end. Like the stapler, the mechanisms of most physical systems are made of\none or more simple machines that work alone or together to make physical tasks\nsuch as nailing, cutting, throwing, carrying and chopping easier to do mechanical\nwork.\nSimple machine is any device which helps us to do work more easier.\nActivity 5.1\nTMake observation in your village and write the type of simple machines\npeople are using in their day to day activity.\nTWrite the purpose of these simple machines in their day to day activities.\nTList the number of activities in your village that are not supported by\nsimple machines.\nTSuggest the type of simple machines that helps people in your village to\ndo their mechanical work easily.\nSimple machines are energy transferring devices. Actually machines do not\ncreate energy or change one form of energy into another. They simply transfer\nmechanical energy involving a small force into mechanical energy involving a\nlarge force. The purpose of simple machines is to make mechanical work easier\nby:\n\u2022Changing the direction of force.

Imagine\nyou need to move a heavy box up to the second floor of a building. It would\nbe easier to carry it up an inclined plane (like a set of stairs) than to throw\nit straight up. But as you move the box up the stairs, it travels a longer\ndistance than if you threw it straight up.\nExercise 5.1\n1.What is the purpose\nof using a fixed single\npulley to take water\nfrom a deep well?\n2.What is the purpose\nof using an inclined\nplane to raise differ-\nent objects in the\ntruck?\n3.What is the purpose\nof using a bicycle\ninstead of walking or\nrunning on feet?\u2022Changing the strength of a force (to multiply force). You can apply a weak\nforce to pull the bottle opener up over a long distance and it exerts a short\nbut strong force on the bottle cap.\nSimple machines make mechanical work easier, but they do not lessen the work\ndone. If distance is gained, then the strength of the force lessens. If strength is\ngained, the distance a force travels lessens.\nSimple machines need energy or a power source to work. In many cases, you\nsupply the energy to apply a force by pushing or pulling, but energy can come\nfrom gasoline or electricity, too. All of these are input forces. The machine\u2019s\nreaction or effect is the output. The input and output, the total amount of energy,\nalways remain the same. Simple machines act as force or speed multipliers.\nFigure 5.1 a) A fixed single pulley.To deal with exercise 5.1, it is better to use the terms effort and load .\nEffort (F): is the force exerted on a simple machine (a fixed pulley, an inclined\nplane, etc.) or a compound machine (e.g. a bicycle) by an external body like a\nhuman being.\nWork input =effort\u00d7distance moved by effort (5.1)\nIn order to do a mechanical work you need to move this effort through a distance.\nLoad (L): is a force exerted by a simple machine (a fixed pulley, an inclined plane,\netc.) or a compound machine (e.g. a bicycle) on an object to be lifted or moved. A\nmachine also provides a work output; this may be used to move a load.\nWork output =load\u00d7distance moved by load (5.2)\nSuppose in a fixed single pulley an effort moves 2m in one second to lift a bucket\nof water from a well, and the bucket of water moves 2m at the same time. The\nspeed with which the effort moves would be 2m/s and that of the load is 2m/s.\nHere the speed of the effort is the same as the load. So the purpose of the pulley is"

A\nfixed pulley is used to change the direction of the force. A fixed pulley is the only\npulley that when used individually, uses more effort than the load to lift the load\nfrom the ground. The fixed pulley when attached to an unmovable object e.g.\na ceiling or wall, acts as a first class lever with the fulcrum being located at the\naxis but with a minor change, the bar becomes a rope. The advantage of the\nfixed pulley is that you do not have to pull or push the pulley up and down. The\ndisadvantage is that you have to apply more effort than the load.\nActivity 5.10\n1.In a compound\npulley discuss the\npurposes of a fixed\npulley and a mov-\nable pulley?\n2.Construct or design\npulley systems with:\na)V.R=3\nb)V.R=4\nc)V.R=5\nd)V.R=6A movable pulley: In this type of pulley the axle is free to move up and down.\nFor a movable pulley if one end of the rope is fixed, applying an effort to the other\nend of the rope will effectively provide about 2 times a force. A movable pulley\nhas a V.R=2.That is in order to lift the load 1m you would have to pull 2 m of the\nrope through the pulley. The main disadvantage of a movable pulley is that you\nhave to pull or push the pulley up or down.

In this case, x is the distance by which the\nspring is either stretched or compressed and is measured from the equilibrium\nposition.\nIf the object is displaced form x = 0, the spring pulls (or pushes) it back to\nthe equilibrium position (x = 0). Thus, the spring produces a restoring force\ndenoted by Fr es. The restoring force (or the force exerted by the spring) is directly\nproportional to the displacement of the object from the equilibrium position x.\nMathematically,\nFr es= \u2212kx (6.4)\nwhere, k is a proportionality constant called the spring constant (or stiffness)\nof the spring. The negative sign shows that the restoring force acts opposite to\nthe displacement of the object. This is called Hooke\u2019s law .

A musician\u2019s\ninstrument creates waves that carry sound to your ears. Dialing a cell phone to\ncall a friend sends microwaves from the cell phone antenna; the microwaves carry\nthe signal containing your voice to your friend. Similarly, when you throw a stone\ninto a pond, the energy of the falling stone creates waves in the water that carry\nthe energy to the edge of the pond. Do you think waves require material medium\nfor their propagation? In this section we see that some waves need material\nmedium for their propagation, while others do not need material medium. Waves\nthat require material medium for their propagation are called Mechanical waves .\nOther types of waves known as electromagnetic waves do not need material\nmedium for their propagation.\nMechanical waves travel through a material as a vibration of the particles of\nthe material (water, wood, air, etc.).

In\nother words, in transverse waves, the directions of the particles\u2019 vibrations are at\nright angles to the direction of energy transfer (wave movement). Examples of\ntransverse waves include all electromagnetic waves, waves on strings etc. Figure\n6.7 shows a transverse wave on the string. To generate such a wave, start by tying\none end of a long string or rope to a wall. Pull on the free end with your hand,\nproducing a tension in the string, and then move your hand up and down. Note\nthat the wave travels in the horizontal direction, even though your hand oscillates\nvertically about one spot. The displacement of particles in a string is at right\nangles to the direction of propagation of the wave.\nKey Concept:\nIn a transverse wave,\nthe displacement of\nindividual particles\nis at right angles\nto the direction of\npropagation of the\nwave.\n Figure 6.7 Example of transverse wave on a string.\nIn longitudinal waves the direction of propagation of the wave (the direction\nof energy transfer) is parallel to (in the same direction as) the direction of vibra-\ntions of particles of the medium. This means, the vibrations are forward and\nbackward along the wave. Examples of longitudinal waves include sound waves,\npressure waves, etc. Propagation of longitudinal waves results in the areas of\ncompressions and rarefactions. Compressions refer to regions where the particles\nare pushed together whereas, rarefactions refer to regions where the particles\nmove apart (see Figure 6.8 ). Compressions and rarefactions can be considered\nas the longitudinal version of a crest and a trough, respectively. Moreover, if the\nmedium of propagation is gas, compressions and rarefactions can be taught of as\nregions of high and low pressures, respectively."

In this topic, we explain what a sound is, produc-\ntion and propagation of sound, speed of sound in different media, and reflection\nof sound (echo).\nSound carries energy and loses its energy as it travels. So, the further the sound\ntravels, the more energy it loses and the quieter the sound becomes. Our ears\nare designed by nature to pick up sound transmitted through different materials.\nLike other waves, sound has the properties of frequency, wavelength, amplitude,\nand speed."

Sound\nis generated by the series of vibrations of an object. Every source of sound is in a\nstate of vibration.\nActivity 6.4\nTake different ma-\nterials such as a\nwhistle, a ruler, a\ntuning fork, etc from\nyour locality and\nproduce a sound\nusing them.

Then touch the pith ball with the fork, you can see the pith ball will fling\naway. This shows that the energy on the prong is transferred to the pith ball, and\nthe pith ball starts to vibrate.\nAll the sounds you hear are produced by a vibrating object.

The produced sound travels in\nevery direction, in the form of energy and reaches your ear.\nActivity 6.6\nTThis activity shows the transmission of sound through solids.

The\nreflection of sound from hard surfaces is called an \"echo\".\nHard substances such as walls, rocks, hills, metals, wood, buildings, etc. are good\nreflectors of sound since they are polished and hard. But when sound strikes soft\nsurfaces such as wool, cloth, etc. most of the sound energy is absorbed. When\nyou shout or whistle while you are at some distance away from a tall building or a\nmountain, you may be able to hear the original sound and the reflected sound as\ntwo separate sounds.\nKey Concept:\nThe reflection of sound from hard surfaces is called an echo."

It is made of metallic oxides, pressed into a bead, disk, or cylin-\ndrical shape and then encapsulated with an impermeable material such as\nglass.There are two types of thermistors: Negative Temperature Coefficient\n(NTC) and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC). With NTC thermistor,\nwhen the temperature increases, resistance decreases. Conversely, when\ntemperature decreases, resistance increases. This type of thermistor is used\nthe most. A PTC thermistor works a little differently. When temperature\nincreases, the resistance increases, and when temperature decreases, resis-\ntance decreases. This type of thermistor is generally used as a fuse.Typically,\na thermistor achieves high precision within a limited temperature range of\nabout 50oCaround the target temperature. This range is dependent on the\nbase resistance\n6.Radiation Thermometers\nFigure 7.13 A radiation thermome-\nter.Radiation thermometers are not based on any change of property with tem-\nperature but use the electromagnetic radiation from a body to be measured.\nAs the body warms up, the total radiation it emits increases rapidly and\nthe spectral distribution shifts to shorter wavelengths. The temperature\ncan thus be determined by measuring the radiation, and there is a clear\nadvantage that all the detecting equipments is remote from the hot body.\nThe application areas of radiation thermometer are quite extensive. They\nare frequently used in industrial processes, the professional sector and in\nparticular to monitor main supply units or to measure the temperature of\ncomponents in motors or machines. Glass and electrical industries use\nmany forms of radiation thermometers."
