Example, gold, \nsilver, water, soap, table salt, etc (Figure 1.1 ). \nMatter is a physical substance, that which occupies space and possesses rest mass. \nExample, book, pencil, television, stool, etc. \nThe property of a substance is its attribute, quality, or characteristic. Every substance, \nin the universe in which we live, has its own properties by which we can distinguish it \nfrom other substances. This is because every substance has its own unique composition \nand structure.

Due to this change, it transforms from one form into the other. The transformation of a substance is a marked change in form, nature, or \nappearance. These transformations are accompanied by energy changes. "

Physical chemistry: It is the study of macroscopic properties, atomic properties, \nand phenomena in chemical systems. A physical chemist may study such things as the rates of chemical reactions, the energy transfers that occur in reactions, or the physical structure of materials at the molecular level.\nii. Organic chemistry: It is the study of substances containing carbon. Carbon is one of the most abundant elements on Earth and is capable of forming a tremendously vast number of chemicals (over twenty million so far). Most of the chemicals found in all living organisms are based on carbon."

Let us look at some of them one by one.\nA. Agriculture\nThe study of chemistry has brought the world with chemical fertilizers such as calcium super phosphate, urea, ammonium sulphate, and sodium nitrate. These chemicals have assisted greatly in increasing the yield of fruits, vegetables, and other crops (Figure 1.4). Chemistry has been effective in the manufacture of pesticides, which have lessened the crop damage. Depending on the targeted pest, pesticides include fungicides, herbicides, and insecticides. Thus, we can supply to the ever-growing demand for food. Chemistry has also an important role in the manufacturing of better-quality plastic pipes for irrigation, and is commonly used in farming. This has massively increased irrigation resulting in a better climate in which the crops grow.\nB. Food Production\nOther than its great contribution in the production of different agricultural products, chemistry has led to the discovery of different kinds of food preservatives. These chemicals have greatly assisted to preserve food products for a longer period. It has given methods to test the presence of adulterants which ensure the supply of pure foodstuff.\tConsumers\thave\tbenefi\tted\tfrom\tnew\ttechnologies\tthat\thave\tincreased\ttheir\tfood\u2019s\tavailability,\tappearance,\tnutritional\tcontents\tand\t\ufb02\tavor.\tA\tlocal\texample\tof\tfood processing and keeping it for a longer period of time is the preservation of raw meat."

There are two categories of uncertainty: systematic and random. 1. Systematic uncertainties are those which consistently cause the value to be too large or too small. Systematic uncertainties include such things as reaction time, inaccurate meter sticks, optical parallax and miscalibrated balances. In principle, systematic uncertainties can be eliminated if you know they exist. \n2. Random uncertainties are variations in the measurements that occur without a pre-dictable pattern. If you make precise measurements, these uncertainties arise from the estimated part of the measurement. Random uncertainty can be reduced, but never eliminated. We need a technique to report the contribution."

Thus, the result will be within the interval but all values within the interval have the same probability to represent the result. \nExcept when all the numbers involved are integers (for example, in counting the number \nof students in a class), obtaining the exact value of the quantity under investigation is often impossible. For this reason, it is important to indicate the margin of error in a\tmeasurement\tby\tclearly\tindicating\tthe\tnumber\tof\tsignifi\tcant\tfi\tgures,\twhich\tare\tthe\tmeaningful\tdigits\tin\ta\tmeasured\tor\tcalculated\tquantity.\tWhen\tsignifi\tcant\tfi\tgures\tare\tused, the last digit is understood to be uncertain. For example, we might measure the volume of a given amount of liquid using a graduated cylinder (see Figure 2.4) with a scale that gives an uncertainty of 1 mL in the measurement. If the volume is found to be 6 mL, then the actual volume is in the range of 5 mL to 7 mL.

Discuss the results with the \nrest of the class.\n  Activity 2.2\nCalculating uncertainties \nThere are several techniques that will produce an estimate of the uncertainty in the value of the mean. Since we are expecting students to produce an estimate of the uncertainty any suitable value that indicates half the range is acceptable. \nExample 2.2:  A student measures the diameter of a metal canister using a ruler \ngraduated in mm and records these results: \nDiameter/mm\nReading 1 Reading 2 Reading 3 Mean\n66 65 61 64\nThe uncertainty in the mean value (64 mm) can be calculated as follows:\na. Using the half range\nThe range of readings is 61 mm \u2013 66 mm so half the range is used to determine the uncertainty. Uncertainty in the mean diameter = (66 mm \u2013 61 mm)/2 = 2.5 mmTherefore, the diameter of the metal canister is 64 mm \u00b1 2.5 mm. Since a ruler graduated in mm could easily be read to \u00b1 0.5 mm, it is acceptable to quote the uncertainty as \u00b1 2.5 mm for this experiment. \nb. Using the reading furthest from the mean\nIn this case, the measurement of 61 mm is further from the average value than 66 mm \ntherefore we can use this value to calculate the uncertainty in the mean.Uncertainty in the mean diameter = 64 mm \u2013 61 mm = 3 mm.

Using the resolution of the instrument\nThis is used if a single reading is taken or if repeated readings have the same value. \nThis is because there is an uncertainty in the measurement because the instrument used to take the measurement has its own limitations.  If the three readings obtained above were all 64 mm then the value of the diameter being measured lies somewhere between 63.5 mm and 64.5 mm since a meter rule could easily be read to half a millimeter.  In this case, the uncertainty in the diameter is 0.5 mm. Therefore, the diameter of the metal canister is 64 mm \u00b1 0.5 mm. This also applies to digital instruments. An ammeter records currents to 0.1 A. A current of 0.36 A would be displayed as 0.4 A, and a current of 0.44 A would also be displayed as 0.4 A. The resolution of the instrument is 0.1 A but the uncertainty in a reading is 0.05 A.\nThe typical uncertainty of a top loading balance is 0.05 g.

For example, chemists developed polymers (very large molecules) that manufacturers use to make a wide variety of goods, including clothing,\tcooking\tutensils,\tartifi\tcial\torgans,\tand\ttoys.\t\nChemistry is evidence based. All chemical statements are based on experiment. \nChemistry is part of the body of modern science. It shares the experimental method of all sciences. It improves in time also using new discoveries and concepts from other sciences. In turn, it provides both theoretical and experimental tools to different sciences. Biology and Geology cannot be studied without a thorough understanding of chemical phenomena. Indeed, because of its diverse applications, chemistry is often called the \u201ccentral science.\u201d\n2.2.1 The Scienti\ufb01  c Method\nConduct the following activity and present your \nfi\tnding\tto\tthe\tclass.\t\na.

In order to start one, an observation has to be made into any observable aspect or phenomena of the universe and a question needs to be asked pertaining to that aspect.

The chemical laboratory poses similar hazards and yet it can be no more dangerous than any other classroom if the following safety rules are always observed. Most of them are based on simple common sense. \n1. Responsible behaviour is essential. The dangers of spilled acids and chemicals and \nbroken glassware created by thoughtless actions are too great to be \ntolerated. \n2. Wear approved eye protection at all times in the laboratory and in any area where chemicals are stored or handled. The only exception is when explicit instructions to the contrary are given by your teacher. \n3. Perform no unauthorized experiments. This includes using only the quantities instructed, no more.  Consult your teacher if you have any doubts about the instructions in the laboratory manual. \n4.

A laboratory apron or lab coat provides protection at all times. A lab apron or lab coat is required when you are wearing easily combustible clothing (synthetic and light fabrics).\nb. It is advisable to wear old clothing to laboratory, because it is both generally not\tas\tloose\tand\t\ufb02\tammable\tas\tnew\tclothing,\tand\tnot\tas\texpensive\tto\treplace.\n13. Keep your work area neat at all times. Clean up spills and broken glass immediately. Clutter not only will slow your work, but it leads to accidents. Clean up your work space, including wiping the surface and putting away all chemicals and equipment, at the end of the laboratory period. \n14.

Always pour acids into water when mixing. Otherwise the acid can spatter, often quite violently.  Pour acid into water.\n16. Do not force a rubber stopper onto glass tubing or thermometers. Lubricate the tubing and the stopper with glycerol or water.  Use paper or cloth towelling to protect your hands. Grasp the glass close to the stopper.\n17.

An unprepared student is a hazard to everyone in the room. \n19. Spatters are common in chemistry laboratories. Test tubes being heated or containing reacting mixtures should never be pointed at anyone.  If you observe this practice in a neighbour, speak to him or her or the teacher, if needed. \n20.

As \nan intensive property it is independent of the quantity of material measured since it is the ratio of the mass of an object to its volume. The density of an object can be determined by a variety of methods. In this experiment you will practice using a balance to measure mass. In addition, you will learn how to measure volume using a graduated cylinder and a pipet and learn how to calibrate the pipet.

The proper use of a sensitive balance is critical to useful mass measurements.  Also, pipeting is a very useful, accurate, and common method for transferring exact volumes of liquids.  Therefore, the instructor should demonstrate good balance and pipet techniques to the class at the beginning of the laboratory period.  Please note that when a portion of the experiment contains the instruction \u201cRepeat . . . twice,\u201d each portion is to be performed all the way through three times:  initially and two repetitions.\nPart I:  Measurements\nA. Mass Measurements\nAfter balance instruction, you will be assigned or allowed to select a balance for use during the experiment. \n1. Zero the balance after cleaning the pan.\n2. Measure the mass of a clean dry 50 mL beaker to the nearest \u00b10.001 g.3. Record, in ink, your observation directly into the lab notebook.4. Remove the beaker from the pan.  Again, clean the balance pan and zero the balance.\n5. Weigh the same beaker as before (step 2) and record the result.6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 one more time.7. From the three mass measurements, calculate the average mass of the beaker.8. Repeat steps 4 and 5 using a second balance (just one weighing).9. Repeat steps 4 and 5 using a third balance (just one weighing). \nB. Volume Measurements\nUse of a pipet: In order to accurately measure a liquid volume using a pipet, you must consider several things. Most volumetric pipets are designed to deliver rather than\tto\tcontain\tthe\tspecifi\ted\tvolume.\tThus,\ta\tsmall\tamount\tof\tliquid\tremains\tin\tthe\ttip\tof the pipet after transfer of liquid.

To measure the desired volume, a volume of liquid greater than that to be measured is needed in order to keep the pipet\ttip\tunder\tthe\tliquid\tsurface\twhile\tfi\tlling.\t\nWhile holding the pipet ve rtically, squeeze the air out of the suction device and hold \nit against the large end of the pipet, tight enough to obtain a seal.

Wipe the outside of the tip with a clean piece of towel or tissue. With the tip touching the wall of the source container above the liquid level, allow it to drain until the meniscus rests exactly on the line. Now hold the pipet over the sample container and allow it to drain, but be careful to avoid loss from splashing. When the swollen part of the pipet is nearly empty, touch the tip to the wall of the container and continue draining. When the liquid level falls to the tip area, hold the tip to the glass for an additional 20 seconds and then remove. Do not blow out the remaining liquid. \n1. Measure the temperature in the laboratory. Your teacher will provide you with \nthe density of water at this temperature. \n2. Use the same 50 mL beaker from Section A for determining the mass of each \naliquot of water. Rather than re-weighing the empty beaker, the average mass of the beaker determined in Section A may be used as the mass of the dry beaker. \n3. Measure 20 or 25 mL of water (depending on the size of pipet available) into the 50 mL beaker.\n4.

Repeat steps 3 \u2013 8 again using a graduated 50 mL beaker to measure the water.\nPART II:  Density\nA. Density of a Metal Bar (Use the same metal bar for all trials.)1. Zero your balance.

Chemistry is full of abstract concepts that deal with the microscopic world. To explain these abstract and microscopic concepts, scientists spent a lot of time and energy. In this section, we are going to see the origin of the Atomic Theory.\nAll modern scientists accept the concept of the atom, but when the concept of the atom \nwas\tfi\trst\tproposed\tabout\t2,500\tyears\tago,\tancient\tphilosophers\tlaughed\tat\tthe\tidea.\tIt\thas\talways\tbeen\tdiffi\tcult\tto\tconvince\tpeople\tbout\tthe\texistence\tof\tthings\tthat\tare\ttoo small to see. We will spend some time considering the evidence (observations) that convinced scientists of the existence of atoms.\nThe Indivisible Atom\nGreek philosophy was emerged early in the 6\nth century BC, centered in the city of \nMiletus on the Ionian coast in Asia Minor (now called Turkey). In the middle of the 5th\ncentury BC, an ancient Greek philosopher, Empedocles, thought that all materials are \nmade up of four things called elements: earth, air , water , and \ufb01  re.\nPlato (student of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle) adopted Empedocles\u2019 Theory, and \ncoined the term element to describe these four substances. His successor, Aristotle, also \nadopted the concept of four elements. He introduced the idea that elements can be differentiated based on properties such as hot versus cold, and wet versus dry. For example, heating clay in an oven could be thought of as driving off water and adding fi\tre,\ttransforming\tclay\tinto\ta\tpot.\tSimilarly,\twater\t(cold\t&\twet)\tfalls\tfrom\tthe\tsky\tas\train, when air (hot and wet) cools down. The Greek concept of four elements existed for more than two thousand years.\nDemocritus (460-370 B.C) was a Greek philosopher born in Abdera in the North of \nGreece. Democritus was a student of Leucippus, who proposed the atomic theory of matter;\thowever,\tthere\tis\tlittle\tdocumentation\ton\tthe\tphilosophy\tof\tLeucippus.\tIt\twas\tDemocritus, who elaborated extensive works on his theories on the atomic structure of the physical world, of the universe, and the void of space. Although Democritus was a philosopher, he is included among the list of great pioneers of physics and chemistry of the 19\nth and 20th centuries. This is because many of his teachings on the structure of \nmatter were demonstrated by scientists over 2000 years after his death.\nDemocritus taught the theory of atomism, which held the belief that indivisible and \nindestructible atoms are the basic components of all matter in the universe. Thus the word atom is derived from the Greek word atomos meaning indivisible."

All matter is composed of atoms, which are bits of matter too small to be seen.\nThese atoms cannot be further split into smaller portions.

There is a void, which is an empty space between atoms.\nLeucippus believed in the existence of an empty space between atoms. Given that all matter is composed of atoms, then all changes must be as a result of the movement\tof\tatoms.\tHowever,\tto\tmove\tthere\tmust\tbe\ta\tvoid;\ta\tspace\tentirely\tempty of matter through which atoms can move from place to place. The problem with this assumption is that, if there is an entirely void space between atoms, then what held the atoms together? Leucippus and Democritus did not answer this question.\niii. Atoms are completely solid. \nThis means that there can be no void inside an atom itself. An atom would be subjected to changes from outside and could disintegrate, otherwise. Then, it would not be an atom. \niv. Atoms are homogeneous, with no internal structure. \nThe absolute solidity of the atoms also leads to the notion that atoms are homogeneous, or the same all the way through. Another way to express this is that an atom would have no internal structure. \nv. Atoms are different in their sizes, shapes, and weight. \nDemocritus then reasoned that changes occur when the many atomos (now known as atoms) in an object were reconnected or recombined in different ways. Democritus even extended this theory suggesting that there were different varieties of atomoswith different shapes, sizes, and masses. The generally accepted atomic model of Democritus\tis\tcalled\t\u2018the solid sphere\u2019.\nHowever, since Aristotle and other prominent thinkers of the time strongly opposed their idea of the atom, their theory was disregarded and essentially buried until the 16\nth and 17th centuries. In time, Lavoisier\u2019s innovative 18th-century experiments \naccurately measured all substances involved in the burning process, proving that \u201cwhen substances burn, there is no net gain or loss of weight.\u201d Lavoisier established the science of modern chemistry , which gained greater acceptance. This is because \nof the efforts of John Dalton, who modernized the ancient Greek ideas of element, atom, compound, and molecule. Dalton also provided a means of explaining chemical reactions in quantitative terms."

The law of conservation of mass is also \nknown\tas\tthe\t\u2018Law of Indestructibility of Matter\u2019. It states that in any given system that is closed to the transfer of matter (in and out), the amount of matter in the system stays unchanged. A simple way of expressing this law is to say that the amount of matter in a system is conserved. \nThe Law of Conservation of Mass dates from Antoine Lavoisier\u2019s 1789 discovery that \nmass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions. In other words, the mass of any one element at the beginning of a reaction will equal the mass of that element at the end of the reaction. If we account for all reactants and products in a chemical reaction, the total mass will be the same at any point in time in any closed system. These laws are called the Laws of Chemical Combination. Ten years later, Joseph Louis Proust proposed the Law\tof\tDefi\tnite\tProportions , which states that the masses of \nelements\tin\ta\tcompound\talways\toccur\tin\tthe\tsame\tproportion.\tLavoisier\u2019s\tfi\tnding\tlaid\tthe groundwork for modern chemistry and revolutionized science.\nThese theories didn\u2019t reference atoms, yet John Dalton built upon them to develop the \nLaw of Multiple Proportions , which states that the ratios of masses of elements in a \ncompound are small whole numbers. Dalton\u2019s Law of Multiple Proportions drew from experimental data. He proposed that each chemical element consists of a single type "

In the previous unit you have come across the concept of average atomic mass of elements (the detail shall be discussed in 3.5.3).

Although the attempt made to describe the concept atom was good atoms were wrongly understood. Several other scientists were engaged in determining the essence of atoms and a better understanding of atoms was reached. The Modern Atomic theory establishes the concepts of atoms, and how they compose matter.\nDevelopment of the Modern Atomic Theory\nSeveral scientists worked many experiments and have made various observations \non atoms.

The discovery of the proton by Goldstein was done based on the cathode ray experiment conducted by using a perforated cathode (Figure 3.7 ). In his experiment some rays were found to "

When an electric discharge is passed through the gas, some of the molecules of the gas ionised and produce cathode rays. Cathode rays consist of electrons. These electrons move with high speed towards the anode. As they move, they collide with the remaining molecules of the gas in the tube causing them to lose electrons resulting in positive ions. The positive ions formed are attracted by the perforated cathode. The stream of these positive ions causes a glow on the glass wall of the discharge tube. On the other side of the discharge tube, the cathode rays produce a green light. The stream of positive ions so formed constitutes the positive or anode rays.\nHigh-voltage sourcePerforated cathodeRed glowPositive \nraysCathode rays from cathode\nAnodePositive rays from anode \nFigure 3.7 Anode rays traveling through perforations in the cathode resulting in red \nglow on the cathode ray tube.\nWhen the cathode ray tube contained hydrogen gas, the particles of the canal rays \nobtained were the lightest and their charge to mass ratio (e/m ratio) was the highest. \nRutherford showed that these particles were identical to the hydrogen ion (hydrogen atom from which one electron has been removed).

It, however, failed to explain how the positively charged particles are shielded from the negatively charged electrons without getting neutralized. Today we know that the positively charged protons exist in the nucleus of an atom which of course is at the centre of the atomic structure and the electrons are revolving around them. Therefore, Thomson\u2019s prediction is not negligible although it lacks some knowledge.\nMillikan\u2019s Oil Drop Experiment\nSubsequently, an American scientist, Robert Millikan (1909) carried out a series of experiments\tusing\telectrically\tcharged\toil\tdroplets.\tIn\tthis\texperiment\tsome\tfi\tne\toil\tdroplets were allowed to be sprayed into the chamber by an atomizer.

Based on this observation, he concluded that 1.59 x 10\n-19 coulomb is the smallest possible charge, and considered that value as \nthe charge of the electron. With this information and Thomson\u2019s charge-to-mass ratio (1.76 x 10\n8C/g), Millikan determined the mass of an electron (Figure 3.15 ):\nMass of electron =e    \n        e/m  \n1.59 x 10-19C  = 9 x 10-28g\n  1.76 x 108 C/g"

Different atoms have different number of protons, hence different atomic masses. However, it was observed that there was a discrepancy between the actual atomic mass and the calculated atomic mass.\nFor example, an atom of carbon has 6 protons;\ttherefore\tits\tmass\tshould\tbe\tsix\ttimes\t\nthe mass of hydrogen atom which has one proton. But, experimentally, it was found that the mass of carbon atoms is twelve times the mass of hydrogen atom. A similar problem was encountered with regard to the mass of other atoms. Then, what was the \nreason for this discrepancy?\nRutherford\twas\tthe\tfi\trst scientist to predict the reason for this discrepancy. He predicted \nthat along with protons, there were some other neutral particles present inside the nucleus. In a single famous experiment, the British physicist Ernest Rutherford showed explicitly that Thomson\u2019s model of the atom was incorrect. He used \u03b1-particles in his experiment. \u03b1-particles are composite particles consisting of two protons and two \nneutrons tightly bound together. In 1920, Rutherford targeted a stream of positively charged \u03b1-particles at a very thin gold foil target (Figure 3.17a) and inspected \nhow the \u03b1-particles were scattered by the foil. The particles were produced by a sample of radium. Gold was chosen since it could be easily hammered into very thin sheets, minimizing the number of atoms in the target. If Thomson\u2019s model of the atom was correct, the positively charged \u03b1-particles should smash through the regularly dispersed mass of the gold target like cannonballs (see Figure 3.16 ).\nFigure 3.16  A regularly distributed cannonballs."

The presence of these neutrons between the protons neutralises the repulsion among the protons.

For this and other insights, Rutherford was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, in 1908.\nRutherford\u2019s Atomic Model\nThe atom is mostly composed of empty space. The whole positive charge and mass of the atom are concentrated in a small central part known as the nucleus. The size of the nucleus is so small that its diameter is 10\n5 times less than that of an atom. The \ndiameter of the nucleus has been estimated by Rutherford as 10-13 cm in contrast to \nthat of an atom to be 10-8 cm.

So, which particles account for the mass of an atom?\n3. How is it possible to distinguish atoms of one element from atoms of another element? \n  Activity 3.13\nIt is important to be able to differentiate atoms of one element from atoms of another element. Elements are pure substances that make up all other matter, so each one is given a different name. From your grade 7 science lessons you know that the names of elements are represented by unique one- or two-letter symbols, such as H for hydrogen, C for carbon, or He for helium. However, it would be more authoritative if these names could be used to identify the numbers of protons and neutrons in the atoms. That\u2019s where atomic numbers and mass numbers are useful.\nScientists are always interested in atomic number and how it differs between different \nelements since an atom of one element can be distinguished from an atom of another element by the number of protons in its nucleus. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number (Z). This number is very important because it is unique for atoms of a given element. All atoms of an element have identical number of protons, and every element has a diverse number of protons in its atoms (Table 3.2 ). If an atom \nhas only one proton, we know that it\u2019s a hydrogen atom. An atom with two protons is always a helium atom. If scientists count four protons in an atom, they know it\u2019s a beryllium\tatom.\tAn\tatom\twith\tthree\tprotons\tis\ta\tlithium\tatom,\tan\tatom\twith\tfi\tve\tprotons\tis a boron atom, an atom with six protons is a carbon atom . . . the list goes on."

Atoms are neutral in electrical charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons (Table 3.2). For example, hydrogen has an atomic number of 1. This means that an atom of hydrogen has one proton, and, if it\u2019s neutral, has one electron as well. Carbon, on the other hand, has an atomic number of 6, which means that an atom of carbon has 6 protons, and, if it\u2019s neutral, has 6 electrons as well.\nMass Number\nThe mass number (A) of an atom is the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. It is also known as the total number of nucleons in the atom\u2019s nucleus. Do not confuse atomic mass with mass number because it is the average weight of an element. Counting the number of protons and neutrons tells scientists about the total mass of an atom.\nMass number A = (number of protons) + (number of neutrons)\nAn atom\u2019s mass number is very easy to calculate, provided that you know the number of protons and neutrons in an atom.\nExample 3.1 : What is the mass number of an atom of helium that contains 2 neutrons?\nSolution\n(Number of protons) = 2 (Remember that an atom of helium always has 2 protons)(Number of neutrons) = 2Mass number = (number of protons) + (number of neutrons)Mass number = 2 + 2 = 4\nExample 3.2 : How many protons, electrons, and neutrons are in an atom of K (mass \nnumber of 40)?\nSolution\nAtomic number = (number of protons) = 19"

Many isotopes occur naturally. Usually, one or two \nisotopes of an element are the most stable and common. Different isotopes of an element generally have the same physical and chemical properties because they have the same numbers of protons and electrons.\nExample 3.5 : Hydrogen Isotopes\nHydrogen is an example of an element that has isotopes. Three isotopes of hydrogen \nare modelled in Figure 3.25. Most hydrogen atoms have just one proton, one electron, and lack a neutron. These atoms are just called hydrogen . This isotope of hydrogen is \nalso known as protium. Some hydrogen atoms have one neutron as well. These atoms are the isotope named deuterium. Other hydrogen atoms have two neutrons. These \natoms are the isotope named tritium. They are also known as heavy hydrogen.\nFigure 3.25  The three most stable isotopes of hydrogen: protium (A = 1), deuterium (A \n= 2), and tritium (A = 3).\nFor most elements other than hydrogen, isotopes are named for their mass number. For \nexample, carbon atoms with the usual 6 neutrons have a mass number of 12 (6 protons + 6 neutrons = 12), so they are called carbon-12. Carbon atoms with 7 neutrons have an atomic mass of 13 (6 protons + 7 neutrons = 13). These atoms are the isotope called carbon-13.\nStability of Isotopes\nAtoms need a certain proportion of neutrons to protons to have a stable nucleus. Having too many or too few neutrons relative to protons, results in an unstable, or radioactive, nucleus that will sooner or later breakdown to a more stable form. This process is called radioactive decay. Many isotopes have radioactive nuclei, and these isotopes are referred to as radioisotopes . When they decay, they release particles that may \nbe destructive. This is why radioactive isotopes are risky and why working with them requires special suits for protection. The isotope of carbon known as carbon-14 is an example of a radioisotope. In contrast, the carbon isotopes called carbon-12 and carbon-13  are stable.\nThis whole discussion of isotopes brings us back to Dalton\u2019s Atomic Theory . According \nto Dalton, atoms of a given element are identical. But if atoms of a given element can have different numbers of neutrons, then they can have different masses as well. How did Dalton miss this? It turns out that elements found in nature exist as constant uniform "

In other words, a piece of lithium metal \nalways contains both types of naturally occurring lithium (the type with 3 neutrons and the type with 4 neutrons). Moreover, it always contains the two in the same relative abundance. In a lump of lithium, 93% will always be lithium with 4 neutrons, while the remaining 7% will always be lithium with 3 neutrons.\nCalculating mass number of isotopes\nProblem 1 : Lithium Isotopes\na. What are the atomic number and the mass number of an isotope of lithium containing 3 neutrons?\nb. What are the atomic number and the mass number of an isotope of lithium containing 4 neutrons?\nSolutionA lithium atom contains 3 protons in its nucleus irrespective of the number of neutrons or electrons.\na. Atomic number = (number of protons) = 3\n  (number of neutrons) = 3  Mass number = (number of protons) + (number of neutrons)  mass number = 3 + 3 = 6\na. Atomic number = (number of protons) = 3\n  (number of neutrons) = 4  Mass number = (number of protons) + (number of neutrons)  mass number = 3 + 4 = 7\nNote that because the lithium atom always has 3 protons, the atomic number for \nlithium is always 3. The mass number, however, is 6 in the isotope with 3 neutrons, and 7 in the isotope with 4 neutrons.  Naturally, only certain isotopes exist. For instance, lithium exists as an isotope with 3 neutrons, and as an isotope with 4 neutrons, but it doesn\u2019t exist as an isotope with 2 neutrons, or as an isotope with 5 neutrons.\nAtomic Mass\nMasses of separate atoms are very, very small.

We can calculate this by the following equation:\nAverage Atomic Mass = [(% isotope 1)(mass of isotope 1)] \u00f7 100 + [(% isotope 2)\n(mass of isotope 2)] \u00f7 100 + ...\nProblem 2:  Find the average mass of lithium (Li-7, 93% and Li-6, 7%).\nSolution : We follow the following calculation:\nLithium with 4 neutrons has a mass number of 7 and its percentage abundance is 93%.\nLithium with 3 neutrons has a mass number of 6 and its percentage abundance is 7%.\nAverage mass of lithium = (7 x 93) \u00f7100  +  (6 x 7) \u00f7100\n    6.51  +  0.42 = 6.93\nThe average atomic mass of lithium is, therefore, 6.93 amu.Problem 3: Boron has two naturally occurring isotopes. In a sample of boron, 20% \nof the atoms are B-10, which is an isotope of boron with 5 neutrons and a mass of 10 amu. The other 80% of the atoms are B-11, which is an isotope of boron with 6 neutrons and a mass of 11 amu. What is the atomic mass of boron?\nFollowing the same approach as lithium, the average atomic mass of boron is:\nAtomic mass of boron = [(10 x 20) \u00f7100] + [(11 x 80) \u00f7100]             = 2 + 8.8             = 10.8\nThe average atomic mass is, therefore,10.8 amu.Problem 4: Neon has three naturally occurring isotopes. In a sample of neon, 90.92% \nof the atoms are Ne-20, which is an isotope of neon with 10 neutrons and a mass of 19.99 amu. Another 0.3% of the atoms are Ne-21, which is an isotope of neon with 11 neutrons and a mass of 20.99 amu. The remaining 8.85% of the atoms are Ne-22, which is an isotope of neon with 12 neutrons and a mass of 21.99 amu. What is the atomic mass of neon?\nSolution\nNeon has three isotopes. We will use the equation:Atomic mass = [(% isotope1) (mass of isotope1)] \u00f7100  + [(% isotope 2) (mass of "

(Hint begin arranging electrons from the lowest shell, in energy.\n  Activity 3.16\nWe picture an atom as a small nucleus surrounded by a much larger volume of space containing the electrons. This space is divided into regions called principal energy levels. Each principal energy level can contain up to 2n\n2 electrons, where n is the \nnumber\tof\tthe\tlevel\t(n\t=\t1,\t2,\t3,\tetc.).\tThus,\tthe\tfi\trst\tlevel\tcan\tcontain\tup\tto\t2\telectrons,\t2(1\n2)\t=\t2;\tthe\tsecond\tup\tto\t8\telectrons,\t2(22)\t=\t8;\tthe\tthird\tup\tto\t18,\t2(32) = 18, and \nso on.

            "text": "102Chemistry Grade 9 Structure of the Atom\nAtomic theory originated as a philosophical concept in ancient India and Greece. The \nword \u201catom\u201d comes from the ancient Greek word atomos, which means indivisible. \nAccording to atomism, matter consists of discrete particles. However, the theory was one of many explanations for matter and wasn\u2019t based on experiential data. \nIn the middle of the 5\nth century BC, an ancient Greek philosopher, Empedocles , thought \nthat all materials are made up of four things called elements: earth, air, water, and \nfi\tre. Plato, student of Socrates and teacher of Aristotle, adopted Empedocles\u2019 Theory, \nand coined the term element to describe these four substances. His successor, Aristotle , \nalso adopted the concept of four elements. The Greek philosophers\u2019 concept of four elements existed for more than two thousand years. In the 5\nth century BC, Democritus\nproposed that matter consists of indestructible, indivisible units called atoms . However, \nsince Aristotle and other prominent thinkers of the time strongly opposed their idea \nof the atom, their theory was disregarded and essentially buried until the 16th and 17\nth centuries.\nIt took until the end of the 18th century for science to provide concrete evidence of the \nexistence of atoms. In 1789, Antoine Lavoisier formulated the Law of Conservation of \nMass, which states that the mass of the products of a reaction is the same as the mass \nof the reactants.\tTen\tyears\tlater,\tJoseph\tLouis\tProust\tproposed\tthe\tLaw\tof\tDefi\tnite\tProportions, which states that the masses of elements in a compound always occur in the same proportion.\nThese theories didn\u2019t reference atoms, yet John Dalton built upon them to develop the \nLaw of Multiple Proportions, which states that the ratios of masses of elements in a compound\tare\tsmall\twhole\tnumbers.\tHis\twork\tmarked\tthe\tbeginning\tof\tthe\tscientifi\tc\tatomic theory.\nUp to this point, atoms were believed to be the smallest units of matter. In 1897, J.J. \nThomson discovered the electron. Thomson also discovered the charge to mass ratio \nof the electron. He proposed a plum pudding model of the atom (1904), in which \nelectrons were embedded in a mass of positive charge to yield an electrically neutral atom. Subsequently in 1909, the American scientist Robert Millikan found the charge and mass of the electron, in his oil drop experiment.\nErnest Rutherford, one of Thomson\u2019s students, disproved the plum pudding model in \n1909. Rutherford found that the positive charge of an atom and most of its mass were at the center, or nucleus, of an atom. In 1911, Rutherford together with his students Geiger and Marsden described a planetary model in which electrons orbited a small, \npositive-charged nucleus.\nIn 1913, Niels Bohr proposed the Bohr model, which states that electrons only orbit \nthe nucleus at speci\ufb01  c distances from the nucleus. According to his model, electrons \ncouldn\u2019t spiral into the nucleus but could make quantum leaps between energy levels. Subsequently, in 1920, Rutherford discovered the existence of the proton in the nucleus. "

Rutherford, however, was cornered by the other scientists by the question: \u201cWhy does the nucleus not disintegrate in spite of repulsion among the protons?\u201d To explain the stability of the nucleus, Rutherford predicted the presence of neutral particles.\nThe English physicist, James Chadwick bombarded Beryllium nuclei with \u03b1-particles \nand\tobserved\tsome\tradiations\tthat\tpossess\tmaterial\tparticles\tand\tdid\tde\ufb02\tect\tin\tan\telectric\tfi\teld.\tThis\tconfi\trmed\tthe\tfact\tthat\tthese\trays\tcontained\tneutral\tparticles.\tHe\tcalled these neutral particles neutrons . \nElectrons are one of three fundamental particles that make up the atoms.

They have no \ncharge. The mass of a neutron is a little greater (1.0087 amu) than the mass of a proton. Together with protons, they make up virtually all of the mass of an atom.Scientists are always interested in atomic number and how it differs between different elements since an atom of one element can be distinguished from an atom of another element by the number of protons in its nucleus. The number of protons in an atom is called its atomic number  (Z).\nThe mass number (A) of an atom is the total number of protons and neutrons in its nucleus. It is also known as the total number of nucleons in the atom\u2019s nucleus. It is calculated by using the formula:\nMass number A = (number of protons) + (number of neutrons)To write a nuclear symbol, the mass number is placed at the upper left (superscript) \nof the chemical symbol, and the atomic number is placed at the lower left (subscript) of the symbol.\nAll atoms of the same element have the same number of protons, but some may \nhave different numbers of neutrons. Atoms of the same element that differ in their numbers of neutrons are called isotopes . Different isotopes of an element generally \nhave the same physical and chemical properties because they have the same numbers of protons and electrons.\nMass of a single atom is very, very small.

We can calculate this by the following equation:\nAverage Atomic Mass = (%isotope 1)(mass of isotope1) + (%isotope2)(mass of \nisotope 2) + ....Today, in chemistry, the principal energy level or the main energy level of an electron \nrefers to the shell in which the electron is located relative to the atom\u2019s nucleus.

Accurate measurements of the atomic masses of many elements had already been made. Arranging elements according to their atomic masses in a periodic table seemed logical to chemists, who felt that chemical behaviour should somehow be related to atomic mass. \n4.1.1 Dobereiner\u2019s Triads\nIn 1829, German chemist Dobereiner was able to identify several groups of three elements that showed similarity in physical and chemical properties. He observed that in the set of three elements having similar properties (called triads), the atomic weight of the middle element is the arithmetic mean of the atomic weights of other two elements. Some examples of Dobereiner\u2019s triads are as follows (Table 4.2):\nTable 4.2 Examples of Dobereiner\u2019s triads.\nElement At.

It is a dimensionless property because it is only a tendency. It basically indicates the net result of the tendencies of atoms in different elements to attract the bond-forming electron pairs. We measure electronegativity on several scales. The most commonly used scale was designed by Linus Pauling. According\tto\tthis\tscale,\t\ufb02\tuorine\tis\tthe\tmost\telectronegative\telement\twith\ta\tvalue\tof\t4.0 and cesium is the least electronegative element with a value of 0.7.\nAs we move across a period from left to right the nuclear charge increases and the \natomic size decreases, therefore the value of electronegativity increases across a period in the modern periodic table. There is an increase in the atomic number as we move down the group in the modern periodic table. The nuclear charge also increases but the effect of the increase in nuclear charge is overcome by the addition of one shell. Hence, the value of electronegativity decreases as we move down the group. For example,\tin\tthe\thalogen\tgroup\tas\twe\tmove\tdown\tthe\tgroup\tfrom\t\ufb02\tuorine\tto\tastatine\tthe electronegativity value decreases.\nArrange each set of the given elements in order of decreasing electronegativity and explain the observed trend.\na.

Therefore, metals are electropositive and non-metals are electronegative in nature. The elements in period two differ in properties from their \nrespective group elements (for example Li is different from Na, K, Rb, Cs and Fr) due to the small size and higher value of electronegativity."

We have seen that a common \natom contains a nucleus composed of protons and neutrons, with electrons in certain energy levels revolving around the nucleus. In this unit, the main focus will be on these electrons. In Unit 4, we have seen the importance of elements being arranged in groups and periods. We have also discussed the general properties that the elements in groups and periods share. Elements are distinguishable from each other due to their electrons. Because each element has a distinct number of electrons, this determines their chemical properties as well as the extent of their reactivity. In chemical bonding, only valence electrons are involved. This unit therefore deals with the way how the different types of chemical bonds are formed, the properties of compounds formed in each type of chemical bonding, and the electron dot or Lewis structures used to represent molecules or compounds formed in each type of chemical bonding.\n5.1   Chemical Bonding \nAt the end of this section, you will be able to\n\uf03fdefi\tne\tchemical\tbonding\n\uf03fdescribe why atoms form chemical bonds.\nStudents, please form groups and discuss the following \nquestions.

As you \nhave learned in your grade 7 science a chemical reaction involves change in molecular composition of a substance. It has been established that atom is the smallest particle \nof matter which takes part in a chemical reaction. Molecule is the smallest constituent particle of substance which has an independent existence and which represents the properties of the respective elements or compounds\n.\nWhy do atoms form chemical bond?\nMost of the elements in nature have been found to exist in combined state. This is due to the fact that atoms of some elements are unstable by their own. There are, however, some atoms which have independent existence and are considered to be highly stable. Except those of a few elements, the atoms of most of the elements have an inherent tendency to combine and form molecules or compounds. The combining atoms may belong to the same element or different elements. Within the molecules, the atoms are held together by attractive forces. A chemical bond  is, therefore, the \nforce that holds atoms together to form molecules or compounds. \nOctet Rule\nThe American chemist Gilbert Lewis (1875-1946) used this observation to explain the types of ions and molecules that are formed by other elements. He called his explanation the octet rule. The octet rule states that atoms tend to form compounds in ways\tthat\tgive\tthem\teight\tvalence\telectrons,\tand\tthus\tthe\telectron\tconfi\tguration\tof\ta\tnoble gas (except helium). \nIn the preceding unit we have discussed about the valence electrons of the atoms of \nelements in each group in a periodic table. The valence electrons of all atoms are between 1and 8. Most elements follow the octet rule in chemical bonding, which means\tthat\tan\telement\tshould\thave\teight\tvalence\telectrons\tin\ta\tbond\tor\texactly\tfi\tll\tup its valence shell. Having a total of eight valence electrons ensures that the atom is stable.

There, however, are exceptions to this rule. For example hydrogen and helium need only two electrons on their valence shell to become stable. The group IIA elements could also become stable having six valence electrons.\nHow could atoms satisfy the Octet Rule?\nThere are three ways in which atoms can satisfy the octet rule.  \ni. By losing their own valence electrons.ii. By gaining valence electrons from other elements.  iii. By sharing their valence electrons with other atoms.  "

Generally, the electrons are either added to or lost \nfrom the valence shell of an atom. the inner-shell electrons do not participate in this type of chemical interaction. Ionization generally involves a transfer of electrons between atoms or molecules. The process is driven by the achievement of more stable electronic\tconfi\tgurations,\tsuch\tas\tthe\toctet\trule.\tPolyatomic\tand\tmolecular\tions\tcan\talso be formed, generally by gaining or losing elemental ions, such as H\n+, in neutral \nmolecules. Polyatomic ions are generally very unstable and reactive.\nA common example of an ion is Na+ (read as sodium cation or ion). According to \nTable 5.1, sodium has a +1 charge when it contains ten electrons (neutral sodium has \n11 electrons). However, according to the octet rule, sodium would be more stable with 10 electrons (2 in its  innermost shell, 8 in its outermost shell). We have said that metals lose electrons in order to attain  octet. Therefore, sodium metal tends to lose an electron to become more stable. On the other hand, chlorine, a non-metallic element tends to gain an electron to become Cl\n\u2013 (read as chloride ion). Chlorine naturally has \n17 electrons, but it would be more stable with 18 electrons (2 in its  innermost shell, 8 in its second shell, and 8 in its valence shell). Therefore, chlorine will take an electron from another atom to become negatively charged. As a general rule, the charge of all group IA metals is 1+, group IIA metals is 2+, group IIIA metals is 3+, group VIIA nonmetals is -1. Group IVA to VIA will not form an ionic bond in most cases, and they are not the topic of this section. "

            "text": "146Chemistry Grade 9 Chemical Bonding\nIonic Bonding\nLet us consider the chemical bond that will be formed between sodium metal and chlorine. As we have discussed above, sodium will lose its outermost electron to attain octet and hence will become sodium cation (Na\n+;\t2,8).\tChlorine\tbeing\ta\t\tnon-metal,\t\naccepts the electron sodium has lost and becomes a chloride ion (Cl_, 2,8,8). When \nthe two oppositely charged ions come together, they will be held together by an electrostatic force and result in the formation of sodium chloride (NaCl), commonly known as table salt. A bond formed by two oppositely charged ions due to electrostatic force is known as an ionic bond . The process of forming such a bond is called ionic \nbonding . Figure 5.2 shows the formation of an ionic bond between sodium and chlorine \natoms using atomic diagrams.\nThere is another alternative for sodium and chlorine to attain the octet rule. Sodium, \ninstead of losing its valence electron, needs to gain another seven electrons to its outermost shell in order to attain eight electrons on its valence shell. This, however, is\tvery\tdiffi\tcult\tto\tbe\tachieved\tby\tsodium\tbecause\tmetals\ttend\tto\tlose\telectrons.\tSecondly, gaining seven electrons needs a large amount of energy. Chlorine, on the other hand, is a non-metallic element  that tends to gain electrons than losing its outermost electrons. If chlorine wants to achieve the octet rule by losing its seven valence electrons, which of course is the second option, it needs a large amount of energy. It is, therefore, easy for sodium to lose one electron than gaining seven extra electrons on its valence shell. It will be easy for chlorine to gain one electron than losing\tits\tseven\tvalence\telectrons\tto\tfulfi\tl\tthe\toctet\trule.\t\t\nLet us consider another example, the formation of an ionic bond between calcium and \nchlorine.\tCalcium\twith\tatomic\tnumber\t20\thas\tan\telectronic\tconfi\tguration\tof\t2,8,8,2.\tIn order to achieve octet, calcium removes its two valence electrons. This will make calcium a cation (Ca\n2+;\t2,8,8)\tbecause\tthe\tnumber\tof\telectrons\tis\tless\tby\t2\tthan\tthe\t\nnumber of protons. Chlorine as we have discussed above, needs only one electron to fulfi\tl\toctet.\tThe\ttwo\telectrons\tremoved\tfrom\tcalcium\twill,\ttherefore,\tbe\treceived\tby\ttwo chlorine atoms to make two chloride ions (2Cl\n_). One calcium cation (Ca2+) will \nbe attracted by the two chloride ions (2Cl_) resulting in calcium chloride (CaCl2). The \natomic diagram in Figure 5.3  depicts the ionic bond formation between calcium and \nchlorine.\nAs a general rule, ionic bond is formed between a metallic and a non-metallic  elements. \nFor atoms with the largest electronegativity differences (such as metals bonding with non-metals), the bonding interaction is called ionic, and the valence electrons are typically represented as being transferred from the metal atom to the non-metal. Once the electrons have been transferred to the non-metal, both the metal and the non-metal are considered to be ions. The two oppositely charged ions electrostatically attract each other to form an ionic compound."

An ionic bond is formed when there is a large electronegativity difference between the elements participating in the bond formation. The greater the electronegativity differences among the bonding atoms, the stronger the attraction between cation and anion. The properties of ionic compounds depend on how strongly the cations and anions attract each other in an ionic bond. Based on the above behaviour, iconic compounds exhibit the following properties:\nThey Form Crystals\nAs we know substances can exist in one of the three states, namely solid, liquid, or gas. A solid-state substance can exist as powder, crystal, or amorphous. Most ionic compounds exist in crystalline solid form. The constituent particles of the crystals are "

Therefore, a high temperature is required to melt and boil ionic compounds. The process of melting an ionic compound requires the addition of large amounts of energy in order to break all of the ionic bonds in the crystal and let the ions move freely. For example, breaking the ionic bonds in sodium chloride to make it melt requires a temperature of about 800\noC. We call this temperature, melting point. It requires a very high temperature-\n1465\u00b0C to boil sodium chloride. Boiling a substance means converting its constituents into a gaseous form.\nThey are Hard and Brittle\nIonic crystals are hard because the positive and negative ions are strongly held together by electrostatic attraction force. It takes a large amount of mechanical force, such as striking a crystal with a hammer, to force one layer of ions to shift relative to its neighbour. Such striking brings ions of the same charge next to one another (Figure 5.5). The strong repulsive forces between like-charged ions cause the crystal to break. The property of being hard but liable to be broken is known as brittleness .  \nFigure 5.5  Appearance of sodium chloride crystal before and after hitting.\nThe sodium chloride crystal is shown in two dimensions (Figure 5.5, left). When struck \nby a hammer, the negatively-charged chloride ions are forced near one another and the repulsive force causes the crystal to shatter ( Figure 5.5 , right)."

Solubility depends on the chemical nature of both the solute and the solvent, and the temperature and pressure. One way of classifying solvents is into polar and non-polar. Polar solvents dissolve polar compounds and non-polar solvents dissolve non-polar compounds. This is commonly referred to as \u201clike dissolves like\u201d.

These four electrons can be gained by forming four covalent bonds, as illustrated below for carbon in CCl\n4 (carbon tetrachloride) and \nsilicon in SiH4\t(silane).\tBecause\thydrogen\tonly\tneeds\ttwo\telectrons\tto\tfi\tll\tits\tvalence\t\nshell, it is an exception to the octet rule.\nGroup\tVA\telements\tsuch\tas\tnitrogen\thave\tfi\tve\tvalence\telectrons\tin\tthe\tatomic\tLewis\tsymbol: one lone pair and three unpaired electrons.

In \nreality no bond or a compound is either completely covalent or ionic. Even in case of covalent bond between diatomic molecules, there is some ionic character.\nWhen covalent bond is formed between two similar atoms, for example in H\n2 , O2 , \nCl2 , N2 or F2 the shared pair of electrons is equally attracted by the two atoms. As a \nresult electron pair is situated exactly between the two identical nuclei. The bond so \nformed is called nonpolar covalent bond.

The two hydrogens have equal electronegativity (2.1), and the difference between the electronegativities will be zero. Therefore, the covalent bond in H\n2 is  \nnon-polar. Generally, all homoatomic molecules like O2, N2, Cl2are non-polar covalent \nmolecules. \nLet us consider the heteronuclear polyatomic molecule ethane (C2H6). There are two \ndifferent types of covalent bonds in ethane i.e., H-C and C-C. The electronegativity \nvalue difference between hydrogen (2.1) and carbon (2.5) will be 0.4, which is below the minimum value for a polar covalent bond. The C-C bond is non-polar because there is no electronegativity value (0.5) difference between the two carbons. Hence, ethane is a nonpolar covalent molecule. \nOther examples of non-polar molecules  include any of the homonuclear diatomic \nelements (H\n2, N2, O2, Cl2 which are truly non-polar molecules), carbon dioxide \n(CO2), benzene (C6H6), carbon tetrachloride (CCl4), methane (CH4), ethylene (C2H4). \nhydrocarbon liquids (gasoline and toluene), and most organic molecules.\nNon-polar molecules also form when atoms sharing a polar bond arrangement such \nthat the electric charges cancel out each other. For example, in CO2 and CCl4 the \nindividual C-O and C-Cl bonds are polar. This is because, in the case of C-O bond the electronegativity value difference between carbon (2.5) and oxygen (3.5) is 1.0. Hence, the bond is polar. Similarly, in C-Cl bond the electronegativity value difference between carbon (2.5) and chlorine (3.0) is 0.5, which is the minimum value requirement for a polar covalent bond. However, in CO\n2 the molecular structure is linear O=C=O \nand the charges on the two oxygen atoms cancel out each other as they are oriented in the opposite directions (see below) making the molecule non-polar. In the case of CCl\n4, the chlorines arrange themselves in a tetrahedral geometry (see below) around \nthe carbon atom , and each partial charge on the four chlorine atoms will cancel out each other. This made CCl\n4 a nonpolar covalent molecule. \n      \nPolar Covalent Molecules\nIn many covalent bonds the electrons are not shared equally between two bonded atoms. For example, in hydrogen chloride (HCl) the electrons are unevenly distributed between the two atoms because the atoms that share the electrons in the molecule are different and have different electronegativities. A bond in which electrons are shared unevenly is called a polar bond or polar covalent bond . A polar bond has a \nslight positive charge on one end and a slight negative charge on the other end.

Polar bonds form when there is a difference between the electronegativity values of the atoms participating in a bond. Polar molecules also form when the spatial arrangement of chemical bonds leads to a more positive charge on one side of the molecule than the other.\nThe HCl bond and other polar bonds can be thought of as being intermediate between \na non-polar covalent bond, in which the sharing of electrons is exactly equal, and an ionic bond, in which the transfer of the electron(s) is nearly complete.\nLet us consider one more example, a water molecule H\n2O. The  electronegativity value \ndifference between oxygen and hydrogen (3.5-2.1 = 1.4) tells us the H-O bond is \npolar. The magnitude of the electronegativity difference tells us how strongly polar the H-O bond is. Unlike CO\n2, the shape of a water molecule is a bent or V-shape and \nunlike CO2 the net charge in H2O will not cancel out each other. Thus, water is a polar \ncovalent molecule.                 \nOther examples of polar molecules include ammonia (NH3), sulfur dioxide (SO2), \nhydrogen\tsulfi\tde\t(H2S), methanol (CH4O), and ethanol (C2H6O).\nThe Distinction between Polar and Non-polar Covalent Bond and Ionic BondThere is no sharp distinction between a polar covalent bond and an ionic bond, but the following rules are helpful as a rough guide. An ionic bond results when the electronegativity difference between the two bonding atoms is 2.0 or more. This rule applies to most ionic compounds. A polar covalent bond forms when the electronegativity difference between the atoms is in the range 0.5-2.0. If the electronegativity\tdifference\tis\tbelow\t0.5,\tthe\tbond\tis\tnormally\tclassifi\ted\tas\ta\tcovalent\tbond, with little or no polarity. Generally, ionic compounds are highly polar. Atoms of elements with comparable electronegativities tend to form moderately polar covalent bonds with each other because the shift in electron density is usually small. Atoms of the same element, which have the same electronegativity, can be joined by a pure nonpolar covalent bond."

Is there another possible way for two atoms to f orm \na covalent bond other than through the  equally sharing of electrons between two atoms? Explain.\nActivity 5.9\nIn the previous sections, we have discussed ionic and covalent bonding. There is a third  possibility in which unstable atom becomes stable and it is by sharing electrons. However, the sharing is only from one atom. A  coordinate covalent bond or sometimes known as a dative bond is a covalent bond where the electron pair is provided by \nonly one of the bonded atoms but shared by both atoms after bond formation (Figure 5.13). The atoms are held together because both of the nuclei attract the electron \npair in similar fashion to that of a covalent bond. Once the coordinate covalent bond is formed, it is impossible to distinguish the origin of the electrons. There are two necessary conditions for a coordinate covalent bond to take place:\ni. One of the atoms must have a pair of electrons, in most cases lone pair electrons. Examples of such molecules include H\n2O, NH3, and H2S.\nii. The other atom must have an empty space in its valence shell in order to accept a pair of electrons. Examples of such molecules include BF\n3, AlCl3, and H+. \nPair of valance electrons \navailable for bondingSharing of valance electrons \ncoming from atom 1\nCovalent molecule \n(Coordinate covalent bond)Atom 2\n(Electron acceptor)Atom 1\n(Electron donor)\nFigure 5.13  Atomic diagram that shows the formation of coordinate covalent bond \nbetween atoms 1 and 2."

They have different physical and chemical properties compared to ionic compounds. In this section, we are going to discuss about the general properties of covalent compounds.\nPhysical Properties of Covalent Compounds\nCovalent compounds form discrete molecules that can exist independently from each other. Therefore, the physical properties of covalent molecules depend heavily on the nature of their interaction with other molecules (intermolecular forces which will be discussed in grade 11). Depending on the nature of these intermolecular interactions, covalent compounds have the following properties.\na. At room temperature, most covalent compounds are gases or liquids. Some \ncovalent compounds are soft solids. The intermolecular force between most covalent molecules is the weak van der Waal\u2019s force and will be discussed in grade 11.\nb. Most covalent compounds have low melting and boiling points. The melting point and boiling point of substances are also dependent on the intermolecular forces between covalent molecules. Diamond is an exception. Its melting point is very high (about 4027 \u00b0C).\nc. Most covalent compounds are poor conductors of electricity. This is because they cannot form ions in their solution form or molten state. Graphite, an allotrope of carbon, has covalent bonds and is an exception as it is a good conductor. Some covalent compounds like HCl that ionise in an aqueous solution are good conductors of electricity as well.\nd. Most covalent compounds are soluble in non-polar solvents and are insoluble in polar solvents like water. The reason behind this is most covalent compounds "

It can easily \nlose these electrons and gain stability in the course of a chemical reaction. Metals are thus highly electropositive in nature. These electrons lost by the metal are called free electrons .\nMetallic bonds occur among the same metal atoms.

The difference between a covalent bond and the metallic bond in sodium atoms, however, is that each sodium atom is being touched by eight other sodium atoms and the sharing occurs between the central atom and the outermost shell on all of the eight other atoms. Each of these eight atoms, in turn, is being touched by eight sodium atoms, which in turn are touched by eight atoms and so on and so on, until all the atoms in that lump of sodium are taken. All of the outermost shells on all of the sodium atoms overlap to give a vast number of molecular shells that extend over the lamp of metal. \nThe electrons freely move within these molecular outermost shells, and therefore \neach electron becomes detached from its parent atom. The electrons are said to be delocalized. The metal is held together by the strong forces of attraction between the positive nuclei and the delocalized electrons (Figure 5.14 ).\nFigure 5.14 Metallic bonding: The Electron Sea Model: Positive atomic nuclei (orange circles) surrounded by a sea of delocalized electrons (small yellow circles).\nSuch type of metallic bonding is sometimes described as \u201can array of positive ions in \na sea of electrons\u201d. Each positive centre in the diagram represents all the rest of the atom apart from the outer electron, but that electron has not been totally lost from the atoms.

Each magnesium atom has 12 protons in the nucleus compared with sodium\u2019s 11. In both magnesium and sodium, the nucleus is screened from the delocalized electrons by the same number (10) of electrons in the inner shells (2 + 8). This means that there will be a stronger attraction from the magnesium nucleus of 2+ than the sodium nucleus which has only a 1+ nucleus.\nSo, there will be a greater number of delocalized electrons in magnesium which leads \nto a greater attraction by the magnesium nuclei. The smaller radius of magnesium atoms leads to stronger attractions of the delocalized electrons than sodium, as they are closer to the magnesium nuclei. Each magnesium atom also has a greater number (twelve) of near neighbours than sodium (eight). These factors, therefore, increase further the strength of the bond in magnesium metal.\nTransition metals tend to have particularly high melting points and boiling points.

Metals tend to lose all their valence electrons while nonmetals gain or share some of their valence electrons.\nAny atom or molecule with a net charge, either positive or negative, is known as an \nion. Net electric charge of an ion is calculated as follows:\nNet electric charge = number of protons \u2013 number of electrons\nAnions are atoms or group of atoms having a net negative electric charge and cations \nare atoms or group of atoms having a net positive electric charge. Ions can be formed by ionization, which is the process of a neutral atom losing or gaining its valence \nelectrons .\nA bond formed by two oppositely charged ions due to electrostatic force is known as an ionic bond. The process of forming such a bond is called ionic bonding . As a \ngeneral rule, ionic bond is formed between metallic and non-metallic elements.\nIn the Lewis symbol for an atom, the chemical symbol of the element with their valence \nelectrons is represented as dots surrounding it. The Lewis dot formula can also be represented using the atomic diagram.\nThe properties of ionic compounds depend on how strongly the cations and anions \nattract each other in an ionic bond. Ionic compounds form crystals, have high melting and boiling points, are hard and brittle, are soluble in polar solvents, conduct electricity when dissolved in water or in a molten state, and have high density. \nAcovalent bond is formed when two atoms share one or more electron pairs.
