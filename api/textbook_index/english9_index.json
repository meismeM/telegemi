It plays a significant role in \nstudents\u2019 academic life. The grade 9 English Textbook is developed \nto satisfy the students\u2019 English language needs at the level and to \nserve them as a backdrop for their future academic career as they \nuse the language for academic purposes. The minimum learning \ncompetencies (MLCs) expected of students are indicated in the \nGrade 9 English language Syllabus, and therefore, the language \ninput as well as activities they perform are developed based on the \nMLC identified by the syllabus designers. The learning outcomes \nexpected of students are built upon the MLC and constitute \nlistening to a variety of texts at different levels (surface and \ndeeper levels), interacting in English, reading and comprehending, \nanalyzing, synthesizing, evaluating and interpreting ideas vis-\n\u00e0-vis their environment, getting meanings of words through \ndifferent strategies, and mastery of selected grammatical elements \nappropriate to the level. The outcomes also embrace students\u2019 \ndevelopment of sentence, paragraph and essay levels writing. The \nstudents are expected to write accurate sentences, paragraphs, and \nessays with some level of fluency as they should balance accuracy \nand fluency in their use of the language.\n[The ten-unit English Language textbook for Grade 9 has specific \nunit objectives. Each of the units consists of six different parts: \nListening Skills, Reading Skills, V ocabulary, Grammar, Speaking \nSkills, and Writing Skills organized in that order. The textbook is \norganized by placing the receptive skills before the productive skills, \nbecause it is presumed that the receptive skills as pre-requisites \nprovide students with language inputs which are relevant to their \nlanguage production.

Many of the grammar lessons are presented in situations \nstudents can easily understand and apply: they are developed in \nsimpler ways to enable the students to express even complex ideas.\nIn other words , the grammar lessons are taught the way they help \nstudents effectively talk in the language. The grammar elements \nare taught linearly or cyclically. Some of the elements such as \n\u2018adverbs of frequency\u2019, \u2018conditional sentences\u2019, and \u2018tenses\u2019 appear \ncyclically, while the rest of the grammar elements appear only once \nin the textbook.

Remember that \u201csmall drops of \nwater make the mighty ocean\u201d.\n3. Secondly, plan your studies. Planning your studies gives \nmeaning to your work. If you know all the steps necessary \nto achieve a goal and these steps are written down on a piece \nof paper, it will be easy for you to see the whole picture.\n4. Thirdly, be motivated. The secret to success is that you \nshould be motivated to learn. Try to avoid boredom by \nhaving fun in what you do. Try to find a positive aspect to \nstudying English. That is, read about what you are interested \nin (hobbies, fields of interest...), watch your favourite films \nin English, listen to your favourite English songs and learn \nthe lyrics . Write your diary in English and read about your \nfavorite stars in magazines or online. Remember, we learn \nbetter and fast things we really want to learn.\n5. Fourthly, manage your time. In order to manage your time \nsuccessfully, having an awareness of what your goals are will \nassist you in prioritizing your activities. Time management \nprovides you with the opportunity to create a schedule that \nworks for you, not for others. This  personal touch gives you \nthe flexibility to include the things that are most important \nto you.\n6. Finally, set a reward for yourself. Set a reward for yourself \nthat you can look forward to. For example, when you reach a \ngoal, give yourself a reward: watch a movie, have a delicious \nsnack, meet your friends, and go to the caf\u00e9."

Road accidents are most often the result of people \nbreaking traffic rules.\n2. There is a reason that traffic rules are created in the first \nplace. However, people break them all the time, especially \nwhen they know that the police don\u2019t always catch them for \ndoing it. While the people who break the rules and get away \nwith it are lucky not to get caught, they are endangering  \ntheir lives whenever they indulge  in such misbehavior. \nThe penalty for breaking traffic rules is generally fine, \nbut worse consequences of this are injuries like paralysis, \nbroken bones, concussions, etc. The worst possible outcome  \nof breaking traffic rules and getting into a road accident is \ndeath.\n3. The traffic rule that people break the most is jumping red \nlights, which means they keep driving even when the signal \nis red. Another bad habit that causes road accidents is drunk \ndriving. What they  don\u2019t realize is that when the light is \nred for them, it is green for someone else and that they are \nputting their lives in danger because of this.  Most of the \ntime, people take turns on the road without putting on their \nindicator to do so, and this can lead to road accidents too. \nThus, breaking traffic rules is very harmful, and people \nshould refrain  from doing so not only out of fear of the \npolice but also because it risks their lives.\n4. Road accidents are very scary , so we must ensure the utmost \nsafety while driving. One must always wear their seat belt, \nonly drive when the signal is green, stick to the speed limit, \nstay in your own lane, wear helmets when riding bikes, "

Gardening gets a person outdoors, exposed to \nnatural air, and refocused on a pleasant activity.\n4. Gardening also offers nutritional benefits to those who \nchoose to plant a vegetable garden. Creating a vegetable \ngarden is a way of ensuring that there is a continuous \nsupply of fresh vegetables to consume . Vegetable gardeners \nknow exactly where their produce is coming from and they \nalso know exactly what chemicals were used to grow the \nproduce. Eating more vegetables, and especially home-\ngrown vegetables, is a simple way to ensure that a body is \ngetting a proper balance of vitamins and nutrients.\n5. And finally, some studies even report that people who are \nexposed to gardens and gardening recover more quickly \nfrom illnesses. It seems that for many people, gardening is \njust what the doctor ordered.\n6. Gardening can be a creative experience as well.

Not surprisingly, the consequences of poverty are often also \ncauses. The poor often experience inadequate healthcare, \nlimited education, and the inaccessibility of birth control. But \nthose born into these conditions are incredibly challenged \nin their efforts to break out since these consequences of \npoverty are also causes of poverty, perpetuating  a cycle of \ndisadvantage.\n2. According to sociologists\u2019 analysis of global inequality \nstudies, the consequences of poverty are many. They have \ndivided them into three areas. The first, termed \u201cthese \ndimentation of global inequality,\u201d relates to the fact that \nonce poverty becomes entrenched  in an area, it is typically \nvery difficult to reverse . As mentioned above, poverty \nexists in a cycle where the consequences and causes are \nintertwined. The second consequence of poverty is its \neffect on physical and mental health. Poor people face \nphysical health challenges, including malnutrition and high \ninfant mortality rates. Mental health is also detrimentally \naffected by the emotional stresses of poverty, with relative \ndeprivation carrying the most robust  effect. Again, as with \nthe ongoing inequality, the effects of poverty on mental \nand physical health become more entrenched as time goes \non. The third consequence of poverty is the prevalence  of \ncrime. Cross-nationally, crime rates are higher, particularly "

While most of us are accustomed  to thinking of slavery in \nterms of the antebellum South, modern day slavery goes \nhand-in-hand with global inequality. In short, slavery \nrefers to any situation in which people are sold, treated as \nproperty, or forced to work for little or no pay. Just as in the \npre-Civil War United States, these humans are at the mercy  \nof their employers. Chattel slavery, the form of slavery once \npracticed in the American South, occurs when one person \nowns another as property. Child slavery, which may include \nchild prostitution, is a form of chattel slavery. In debt \nbondage, or bonded labor, the poor pledge  themselves as \nservants in exchange for the cost of basic necessities like \ntransportation, room, and board. In this scenario, people are \npaid less than they are charged for room and board. When \ntravel is required, they can arrive in debt for their travel \nexpenses and be unable to work their way free, since their \nwages  do not allow them to ever get ahead.\n4. The global watchdog group Anti-Slavery International \nrecognizes  other forms of slavery: human trafficking (in \nwhich people are moved away from their communities and \nforced to work against their will), child domestic work and \nchild labor, and certain forms of servile marriage, in which \nwomen are little more than chattel slaves.\n  \nNow answer the following questions.\n1. How many poverty consequences are discussed in the \npassage? Mention them.\n2. What does \u2018slavery\u2019 refer to?"

As \nyou studied in the previous units, prefixes are word parts that are \nadded at the beginnings of the root words to form new words. They \nmodify the meanings of the words. Prefixes make words negative, \nindicate opinion or show repetition.\nExamples\nUnhappy    The word is formed from the root word \u2018happy\u2019 and \nthe prefix \u2018un\u2019; and the meaning of the root word has \nchanged from positive to negative because of the prefix.\nDisorganized The word is formed from the root word \u2018organize\u2019, \nthe prefix \u2018dis-\u2019   and the suffix \u2018-ed\u2019. Similar \nto the above   example, the prefix has   \nformed a negative meaning to the word.\nSuffixes are word parts that are added at the ends of root words, \nand form new words which can be nouns, verb forms, adjectives \nand adverbs. \nExamples\nforgetful The word is formed by adding the suffix \u2018ful\u2019 to the root \nword \u2018forget\u2019. In this example, we see how the verb \n\u2018forget\u2019 is changed to an adjective, \u2018forgetful\u2019.\nhappiness The word is formed by adding the suffix \u2018ness\u2019 to the \nroot word \u2018happy\u2019. In this example, we see how the \nadjective \u2018happy\u2019 is changed to a noun, \u2018happiness\u2019.\nIn this Unit, you will be introduced with word formation using \nsuffixes. You will also be introduced with few phrasal verbs. The \nsuffixes you will study are \u2013ate, -ise/ ize, -ment, and \u2013tion. "

The linking words include who, whom, whose, that, \nwhich, what, when, where, and why. These linking words that form \nthe relative clauses are called relative pronouns. \nRelative clauses are classified into defining and non-defining relative \nclauses. The defining relative clauses are clauses that provide \nessential information about the thing or the person that it describes. \nFor instance, you may have many sisters and if you produce the \nstatement My sister who works in Hawassa University was awarded \na prize, your listeners may not understand you which of your sisters \nyou are referring to. The relative clause which you have added as \nwho works in Hawassa University clearly distinguishes which of \nyour sisters you have referred to. This kind of relative clause that \ndetermines the noun is called defining relative clause. You should \nnot use commas with defining relative clauses. Please read example \nsentences 1-5 below. The non-defining relative clauses, on the \nother hand, are clauses that provide information about the things or \nthe persons described in the sentence, but the information does not \ndetermine the things or the persons they describe. For example, in \nsentences like My father, who is over 60, still works on the farm, it \nis clear that you have only one father; therefore, the relative clause \nwho is over 60 is not essential to tell us about your father although \nit adds some information  about your father\u2019s age. Non-defining \nclauses are set-off by commas to indicate that the clause is not \ndeterminant of the noun used. Read the examples 6-10 below for \nmore understanding."

It gives \nus energy to keep us health and work. Without the right amount of food or \nthe right kinds of food, people suffer from malnutrition which can result in \ndeath. At least one in eight of the world\u2019s population does not have enough \nto eat. Water, clean, safe drinking water is essential for life. It is vital for \nthe control of diseases such as diarrhea, typhoid and cholera. About 80% \ndiseases are from dirty, unsafe drinking water. \n Housing is a major problem, which can affect the developing countries \nbecause more and more people in developing countries are drawn to cities \nin search of work and a better life. The cities getting overcrowded and the \nsupply of affordable housing in the cities does not match the population \ngrowth so there is a serious of lack of houses, so in developing countries \nthere are nearly more than half of the population living in shanty towns. \nHealth care is important to \u2018ensure a state of complete physical, mental \nand social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or illness. \n70% of the population in developing countries does not have access to any \norganized health care.  \nEducation is another problem in poor countries. There are only four adults in \nten who can read and write and less than one in four children go to secondary \nschool. Education is a very important basic to the development of a nation. \nTo solve the problems of basic needs, people in developing countries \nshould work hard cooperatively to ensure their basic needs are satisfied.

Within the next 25 years, AIDS is set to join heart diseases and \nstroke as the top three causes of death worldwide. Currently \nranked fourth behind heart diseases, stroke and respiratory \ninfections, AIDS is set to become No.3. It accounts for about \n2.8 million deaths every year. But researchers estimate  a \ntotal of nearly 120 million people who could die in the next \n25 years. Overall, researchers predict that in the next three \ndecades, the causes of global mortality will be strikingly \nsimilar worldwide\u2014apart from the prevalence of AIDS in \npoorer countries. Most people will be dying at an older age \nof non-infectious diseases like cardiovascular diseases, \nstroke and cancer.\n2. The World Health Organization estimates that a total of \nat least 117 million people will die from AIDS from 2006 \nto 2030.

Mathers and Loncar analysed data from more than 100 \ncountries. The authors looked at the links between mortality \ntrends and income per capita, as well as factors including \neducation levels and tobacco use. Their research also used \nUN estimates for projected AIDS infection rates and the \nWorld Bank\u2019s numbers for future income per capita.

While it may \nbe possible to avert  some of the impending damage from \nHIV/AIDS, Mathers says that other predictions are unlikely \nto vary significantly. As populations age, he explains, they \nare naturally more susceptible  to illnesses like cancer and \nheart diseases than infectious diseases-even in the developing \nworld.

It can be considered \nas a scheme  of law in which every person receives his/her \ndue from the system, including all rights, both natural and \nlegal.\n2. It is good to understand the difference between equity \nand equality as it helps us to recognize and respond to the \ndifferences. Let us analyze it on the basis of few examples: \nShould per student funding at every school be exactly the same? \nIf we evaluate it, we find that it is the question under the \ndomain  of Equality. Here, we make sure that all the students \nhave equal access to resources which is an important goal. \nAll the students should have the resources necessary for a \nhigh-quality education.\n3. But if we go deeper, we see another question arising. That is, \nshould the students who come from less get more in order to ensure \nthat they can catch up? It is the question of equity where it is \nsensed that the students who are furthest behind (most often \nlow-income students and students of color) require more of \nthose resources to catch up, succeed, and eventually, close \nthe achievement gap.\n4. And on the resulting ground, we come to a conclusion \nto these questions that giving the students who come to \nschool lagging academically (because of factors outside of \na school\u2019s control) the exact same resources as students in \nhigher income schools alone will not close the achievement \ngap. But making sure that low-income students and students \nof color have access to exceptional teachers and that their \nschools have the funding to provide them with the kind of \nhigh-quality education they need to succeed will continue \nus on the path towards narrowing that gap."

If we look at another example about the runners sprinting  \naround an oval track during a competition, through this \nconcept of equality we should treat the runners in exactly \nthe same way, ensuring that they all start at the same place \non the track. On the surface, this seems fair. But we know \nthat runners in the inside lanes have a distinct advantage \nover runners in the outer lanes because the distance they \nhave to travel is shorter. As a result, equality \u2014 starting at \nthe same place \u2014 doesn\u2019t result in fairness. The concept \nof equity, in contrast, would lead us to stagger  the starting \npositions of the runners in order to offset the disadvantages \nfacing those in the outer lanes. In this case, different or \ntailored treatment is a surer path to fairness and justice than \nthe same treatment . John Rawls says justice is of central \nimportance in political practice and theory. In defending or \nopposing laws, public policies and administrative decisions \nof governments, appeals are made to notices of justice. \nJustice is also invoked  in social and political movements, \ncivil- disobedience and opposition campaigns. Thus, the civil \nrights or civil liberties movements are essential movements \nfor justice. While a decent or good society or polity  must \nhave several virtues, according to a widespread view justice \nis the first of them. But the real question is how many are \nfollowing the path of justice. We live in a materialistic \nworld, where ethics, laws and order etc. are less cared \nabout. Everything can be purchased with money even love \nand respect. People generally measure others on the scale \nof richness , \u201cthe richer a person is, the more will be his love and \nrespect in the society\u2019\u2019 and vice-versa.

People with lack of money suffer everywhere; they not \nonly struggle for their survival but also find it hard to earn \nrespect in the society. Being poor is a curse , people with no \nmoney end up doing low paid jobs with no bright future. We \ncan see examples of many domestic workers who work hard \nday and night in the same household throughout their life.\n6. Justice, we see, manifests itself through the channels that \nsociety set up. Setting these channels involve laws that are \nset down by the founders and later rulers of the society. In \ntheory, this is done by a person or group of people selected \nby the community and with inputs from the community \nregarding what issues are important. In practice, though, \nlaws are often created by rulers without the input of the \npeople or without certain situations in mind. This is when \nthe principles of justice and fairness come in. Though there \nare a lot of ways but in many ways the best way to practice \nfairness and justice that has been found so far is the court \nsystem. For example: When a crime has been  allegedly  \ncommitted under the law, the perpetrator  is allowed a trial by \njury. The jury is constructed of people from the community \nwho have no interest or previous disposition in the case. \nThus, the jury is theoretically fair. The defendant and the \naccuser both have their chances to present their reasons for \nwhy a certain verdict should be given. It is not only the job \nof the jury to discern  what events took place and whether \nthey are illegal, but also whether the law is justly applied \nto the current case. In theory, the jury (given true evidence) \nwill decide what is best for the community in the particular \ncase."

Most students would agree that the computer is \nthe greatest invention on earth because it has opened up a \nvast store of easily available information for them. At a click \nof the mouse they get to learn all the things that help them \nto keep abreast with today\u2019s fast moving world.

I knew I should set an achievable goal, \nso I decided to train for a 5K race. My parents were surprised when \nI told them about my goal, because I had never been interested in \nrunning before. In fact, I had never run more than a mile, and I had \nalways been very slow. My friends thought I was joking. Everyone \nassumed that I would quit after a week.\nFortunately, I proved them all wrong. I did two things to achieve \nmy goal. First, I went online and researched a good training plan. I \nfound a website that helps me plan workouts. I start by walking, and \nthen I gradually start running. After that, I joined a local running \ngroup. We ran in the park twice a week, and I made friends who had \nalso decided to run a 5K.\nThree months later, I achieved my goal: I ran in my first race. I \ndidn\u2019t win, but I ran the whole way, so I was proud of myself. Since \nthen, I have run in several races. I have also started training for a \nlonger run. My next goal is to run in a 10K race. My friends have \nstopped laughing at me, and a few of them have even asked me to \nhelp them start."

It is now indeed a challenging task to visualize a world \nwithout the internet.\nOne may define the internet as a large library composed of stuff like \n\u2013 records, pictures, websites, and pieces of information.

There\u2019s no \nquestion about it.\nExample paragraphs of polite agreement and disagreement to the \nstatement the different regions of Ethiopia have best staple foods.\nPolite agreement\nIn my opinion, the different regions of Ethiopia have special staple \nfoods that are delicious. For instance, the Tuhlo in Adigrat and the \nKocho in Gurage are delicious foods. When one eats the kocho with \nchopped up meat called kitfo locally, he/she may think that there is \nno equal food stuff to it anywhere. Tuhlo has also very good taste \nand its food service tradition is special which is really very much \nattractive.

So, I feel that we have variety of delicious food stuffs \nwhich are much enjoyable in Ethiopia.  \nPolite disagreement\nThe different cultural foods in Ethiopia may be enjoyable to many \nEthiopians. But, I think the staple foods may not be delicious to \ntourists who haven\u2019t experienced such kinds of food stuffs. Tourists \nwho come from different corners of the world may have experienced \ndifferent cultural foods of their own. To such kind of people, eating \nnew food stuffs may not be easy.
