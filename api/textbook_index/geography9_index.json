Do you think geography has a single universally accepted \ndefinition? If not, why?\nThe term \u201cGeography\u201d first appeared in history at the time when the Greek civilization \nreached its peak. They defined geography for the first time by combining two words \nof Greek origin namely: Geo and Graphos.\n\u2192 Geo \u2013 which means earth\n\u2192 Graphos \u2013 which means writing\nEratosthenes, a famous Greek Philosopher (276-194 B.C) coined the term Geography \nand defined it as \u201cthe field of study that deals with the description of the earth\u201d. \nNow this definition seems very general when we compare it to the scope of current \ngeography. \nA number of definitions have been given by different scholars of the nineteenth and \ntwentieth centuries. These definitions relate to geography\u2019s current concerns, interests \nand focus.\nHere are some of the most important definitions that scholars have proposed:\n \u00de Eratosthenes (276-196 BC) \u2013 Geography is the description of the \nearth.\n \u00de Alexander Von Humboldt (1769-1859) - Geography is a \nsynthesizing discipline to connect the general with the particular through \nmeasurement, mapping, and a regional emphasis.\n \u00de Concise Oxford Dictionary (1964) - Geography is the science of the \nearth\u2019s surfaces.\n \u00de Hartshorne, R. (1899-1992) \u2013 Geography is a branch of knowledge \nthat is concerned with the provision of an accurate, orderly and rational \ndescription of distributions on the surface of the earth.\n \u00de Yeates, M. (1968) \u2013 Geography is a science that is concerned with the \nrational development and testing of theories that explain and predict the \nspatial distribution and locations of things and phenomena on the surface \nof the earth.\nAs you have read above, each of these definitions includes the idea that geography \nstudies the earth.  Most of them specify the surface of the earth ."

            "text": "  Grade 9 | Geography \n4It is difficult to forward a definition acceptable to all geographers at all times and \nplaces because of the dynamic nature of the discipline and the changes in its scope \nand method of study. However, the following may be widely accepted definitions by \nmost scholars. \nGeography is the scientific study of the Earth that describes and analyses spatial \nand temporal variations of physical, biological and human phenomena, and their \ninterrelationships and dynamism over the surface of the Earth.\n1.1.2  The Scope of Geography\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 What does the word scope mean? What is the scope of geography? \nScope refers to the content (how broad or narrow) of the field of study of a given \ndiscipline, in this case geography. The scope of Geography is very wide. As the scope \nis dynamic, it often changes as discoveries and ideas enter the field. \nGeography studies a great many physical and human features of the world. Its focus \nincludes their causes, effects, and interactions. As a result, the subjects that geography \nexamines include features in the hydrosphere, atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere \nand anthroposphere.\nGeography as a field of study is also concerned with the economic, social, political \nand ecological problems that you hear every day. It is also concerned with modern \ntechnology, such as computers, Global Positioning System (GPS) and Geographic \nInformation System (GIS) to analyze information and draw conclusion with accuracy.\n    NOTE \n \u00deHydrosphere  \u2013 it includes all the bodies of water, i.e., oceans, rivers, lakes and \nothers. \n \u00deBiosphere \u2013 refers to all living organisms in and on the earth\u2019s surface.\n \u00deAtmosphere \u2013 it includes all aspects of air composition surrounding our planet.\n \u00deLithosphere \u2013 it is the solid layer of rocks that covers the entire surface of the planet.\n \u00deAnthroposphere \u2013 it is the part of the environment that is made or modified by \nhumans."

Do you understand the \nextent of its scope?\nIt is true that geography has a very wide scope. However, this does not mean its scope \nis limitless.  The major areas that geography focuses on are: \n \u00dethe earth, its position in the universe and its movements; \n \u00dethe different physical features that constitute the earth\u2019s surface, the forces \nthat cause them, their variations from place to place and their changes over \ntime; \n \u00dethe different relationships between human beings and their natural \nenvironment. Also, the interdependence and the impact that each has on \nthe other; \n \u00dethe conditions of the lower part of the atmosphere and the subsequent \nweather and climatic conditions, together with their spatial distribution \nand variation; \n \u00dethe materials that make up the earth and its diverse landforms; and \n \u00dethe major economic activities of humans and the impacts on the environment. \nTherefore, geography deals with an enormous range of phenomena ranging from \nphysical and biotic to human environment. It is possible to conclude that although \nwide in its scope, geography has certain areas that it focuses upon. Hence, geography \nis a holistic discipline of knowledge and research (academics).\n1.1.3  Branches of Geography\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 What are the two branches of geography?

Does Ethiopia \nhave similar shape  with its neighboring countries? Can you identify the \nshape of each neighboring countries?\nCountries of Africa and the world at large vary not only in location and size but \nalso in shape. Some countries have nearly circular (compact) shapes, others have \nelongated (linear) shapes, and still others have truncated (shortened) shapes. These \nshapes have implications on the administrative, defense and economic integration, \nboth within the country and with respect to outside areas.\nWhen you compare the shape of Ethiopia with the other countries, you find that \nEthiopia has more or less compact (circular) shape. Its shape is considered to be \ncompact or essentially circular because the extreme north-south and east-west spans \nof the country cover comparable distances. You can easily see this approximate \ncircularity in your school atlases and wall maps.\nThere are three theoretical indicators of the compactness of an area:\n \u00dethe boundary - circumference ratio (B/C);\n \u00dethe area - boundary ratio (A/B); and\n \u00dethe actual area - area of the inscribing circle (A/A\u2019)."

They consider 0.5 \u20131.5 values as deviating only \nslightly from circular/compact and therefore indicating approximate compactness. \nIn contrast, smaller values indicate greater divergence from compactness, especially \nas they approach zero (0). These small values reflect tendencies to elongation or \ntruncation. On the other hand, A/B ratio compares the total area of a country under \nconsideration with the total boundary length of the same country. The larger the areal \nsize per unit boundary length is, the more compact the country is.\nFor example, let\u2019s use the boundary-circumference ratio to measure Ethiopia\u2019s degree \nof compactness or index of compactness. In the ratio, circumference is based on the \nassumption of a circle having equal area with the country under consideration.\nIndexofcompactness usingB/CratioCircumferenc eofthecircleBoundary lengtho fthecountry=\nThe formula to find the circumference of a circle having equal areal size as the country \nunder consideration is 2\u03c0r (\u03c0=3.14 ).

It is going to be calculated taking an area of a circle that is assumed to \nhave equal areal size as the country under consideration..

That is why the rivers draining the region (particularly the \nBaro river) have almost a regular flow of water for much of the year .\nThese lowlands of this physiographic region are sub-divided into:\n \u00dethe Tekezze and Angereb Lowlands,\n \u00dethe Abbay Dinder Lowlands,\n \u00dethe Baro-Akobo Lowlands, and\n \u00dethe Omo-Gibe Lowlands. \nThe Tekezze and Angereb Lowlands are the most northerly lowlands, drained by \nTekezze and Angereb. The Abbay Dinder Lowlands extend from south of Metema \ntown up to the southern part of the Abbay River.\nBecause of climatic hardship in most parts of these lowlands, the communities \npractice  pastoralist and semi-pastoralist ways of life. However, there are notable \ntowns, such as Humera, Kurmuk, Omedla and Metema that serve as business centers \nfor the communities living along the Ethio-Sudanese border.\nII. The Southeastern Highlands and Associated Lowlands\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 Can you propose what feature separates these highlands from the northwestern \nhighlands? Which highlands are said to be the components of southeastern \nhighlands of Ethiopia?\nThis physiographic region is found to the southeast of the rift valley.

Kolla is the climate of the hot lowlands \nwith an altitudinal range of 500 to 1500 m a.s.l. Average annual temperatures are \nbetween 20oC and 30oC. Although mean annual rainfall ranges between 410 mm and \n820 mm, it can be as high as 1600 mm in the wet western lowlands of Gambella. \nRainfall is highly variable from year to year. Example: Western lowlands. \ne) Bereha-Zone Areas\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 Can we grow crops in Bereha zone areas?\nBereha is the hot arid climate. Bereha is the climate of the desert \nlowlands that are found below 500 m above mean sea level where the average annual \nrainfall is less than 400 mm, and average annual temperature is over 30oC.  Bereha \nis usually characterized by strong wind, high temperature, low relative humidity, and \nlittle cloud cover. Evapotranspiration is always in excess of rainfall in some places. \nExample: Danakil depression in Afar lowlands. \n2.4.2  Seasonal Variation in Ethiopia\nA season is a period of the year characterized by a particular set of weather conditions \nresulting from the inclination of the earth\u2019s axis and the revolution of the earth around \nthe sun.

How do these differences \noccur?\nIn Ethiopia, temperatures vary from season to season. For example, in most parts \nof Ethiopia, high temperatures are recorded from March to June. Conversely, low \ntemperatures are recorded from November to February.  These variations are primarily \ndue to:\n \u00dethe tilting of the earth at 23\u00bd\u00ba to the normal elliptic, and \n \u00dethe distance of the overhead sun and its apparent north-south movement \nacross the equator as the earth revolves around the sun."

Highland Forests  (forests that grow between 1500 - 3300 m a.m.s.l.  altitude)\nThey consist of:  \n \u00deKerkha (Arundinarial) at an altitude of 2800 \u2013 3000 m a.m.s.l.\n \u00deTid (Juniperous Procera) or Coniferous trees  at an altitude of 2200 \u2013 2800 \nm a.m.s.l.\n \u00deZigba (Podocarpus) at an altitude of 1800 \u2013 2200 m a.m.s.l.\n \u00deWoira (Oliia Africana) and Kosso (Hagenia Abbyssinia at an altitude of \n(1500 \u2013 1800) m a.m.s.l.\nii. Lowland Forests (forests that grow below 1500 m a.m.s.l. altitude)\nThese forests are known as gallery/riverine  forests. In Ethiopia, they grow along \nthe banks of the Awash, Wabe Shebelle, and Genale Rivers etc. where moisture is \navailable in the soil. The predominant trees are Sholla and Warka. In areas where \nmean annual rainfall exceeds 500 mm, Baphia forest predominates.\nFigure 3.6: View of Forest of Southwest Ethiopia (Arbaminch)"

This has made the rivers flow \nswiftly. Many bigger rivers drain towards neighboring countries. Because of this \nand the fact that Ethiopia possesses many rivers and lakes, it is known as the \n\u201cWater Tower of East Africa\u201d.\n \ud83c\udf0dEthiopia has different types of soils. They are basically derived from volcanic, \nmetamorphic and sedimentary rocks. The major types of soil in Ethiopia are \nnithosols, vertisols, acrisols, cambisols, regosols, xerosols, yermisols, luvisols, \nfluvisols and lithosols. The volcanic soil, especially nithosol, is the most widely \nutilized soil. The country\u2019s cereals, coffee, inset, etc. are grown on this soil type.\n \ud83c\udf0dIn Ethiopia, the types of the natural vegetation of an area are highly correlated \nwith altitude and rainfall.

It is \nusually expressed as number of males per 100 females in a population. A ratio greater \nthan 100 shows a greater number \u2013 called an excess \u2013 of males than females. Sex \nratios can affect marriage prospects, labour force participation, and other social and \neconomic variables. The formula for calculating a sex ratio is:\nSexRatioNumber ofFemale sNumber ofmale s*100 =\nAccording to the 1984 census result, the sex ratio for the population of Ethiopia was \n99.4. This means that there were about 99 males for every 100 females. The 1994 \ncensus result showed that it was 101.3 and in 2007 sex ratio was 101.9.

What factors do you think are responsible \nfor such spatial variation in the distribution of people over land?\nThis extreme unevenness is the result of a number of factors operating in combination. \nThese factors can be grouped into two: physical and human.\nA. Physical Factors\nThe most significant physical factors affecting the distribution of population in \nEthiopia are the following. \n \u00deClimate (mainly rainfall and temperature) \n \u00deSoil fertility \n \u00de Natural water supply \n \u00deRelief (slope and altitude) \n \u00deVegetation cover\nIn Ethiopia, most of the physical factors are influenced by altitude. Therefore, altitude \nis the most crucial physical factor influencing patterns of population distribution and \nsettlement in the country. Studies in climatology make it clear that rainfall increases \nwhile temperature decreases with an increase in altitude. Incidentally, this means \nthat rainfall is very low and temperature is high in lowland areas, while rainfall \nis high and temperature is moderately low in the highlands. Since soil formation \nand vegetation growth are closely associated with adequate rainfall and moderate \ntemperature, highlands tend to have better soils and vegetation cover . \nLowlands in Ethiopia are characterized by scarcity of rainfall, high temperature, \nand poor vegetation and soil conditions. In addition to these negative factors, the \nprevalence of tropical diseases such as malaria and yellow fever contributes to the \nsparse population distribution in such areas. \nFor reasons of tropical diseases, most of the valleys of the major rivers of Ethiopia are \nalso characterized by sparse population concentration. The main exception to this is \nthe Awash River Valley, where irrigation agriculture is practiced. This overall pattern \ndiffers from what can be seen in other parts of the world, where valleys of major \nrivers are zones of large concentrations of people. However, with improvements in \nagricultural and medical technology, Ethiopia\u2019s lower major river valleys might, in "

Consequently, the carrying capacity influences the number of \npeople that can inhabit a given area. Being a country of diverse environmental and \ncultural conditions, Ethiopia offers ample evidence of these relationships. \nThe arid and semi-arid lowland areas of Ethiopia are areas that are more suitable \nfor pastoralist activities than for crop farming. By its nature, pastoralism is an \neconomic activity that requires large areas of grazing lands. In most pastoralist areas \nof Ethiopia, the land requirement for grazing is as large as 20 hectares or more per \nhead of cattle. The arid and semi-arid lowlands of Ethiopia that are inhabited by \npastoralists and semi-pastoralists are sparsely settled. Hence, with pastoral herding, \npopulation densities are extremely low.\nAs it has been said earlier, compared to pastoralist areas, crop-farming areas have \ngreater carrying capacity and higher densities of population. This is typically the \ncase in the highland areas of Ethiopia where natural conditions are suitable for crop \ncultivation. In the crop-farming highland areas, the man-land ratio is significantly \nhigher than the one in the pastoralist lowlands. \nHowever, the crop-farming areas of Ethiopia do not have uniform carrying capacities \nor population densities. Population density is significantly influenced by the types \nof crops cultivated. For instance, in the northern and north central highland areas of \nEthiopia, the most cultivated crops are cereals. Cereals have relatively low yields per \nunit area. Therefore, these areas tend to have relatively lower carrying capacities and \npopulation density. IIn contrast, the southern, enset and coffee-growing regions of \nthe country have greater yields per unit area. This is an important reason for the very \nhigh population densities in some zones and weredas of the southern region that you \nread about earlier."

Despite recognizable improvements, \nEthiopia has still a heavy burden of diseases but a low rate of self-reported illness and \nlow health facility coverage and utilization. The available literature indicates that the \nmajority of ill health in Ethiopia is related to potentially preventable, communicable \ndiseases and nutritional disorders. Some of the root causes of the poor health status \nof the population are:\n1. Lack of access to clean water: Rivers and lakes remain the most important sources \nof water particularly for people in rural areas although such waters are largely unsafe. \n2. Lack of adequate nutrition: Studies reveal that malnutrition is rampant and is \namong the highest in the world. About half of the children under the age of five are \nmalnourished, stunted or wasted. Malnutrition remains high as the country has not \nattained food security, or due to poor knowledge about nutritional requirements and \ndietary habits. \n3. Disease related to beliefs, behaviors and traditional practices  which have a \nnegative effect on health status include Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), and early \nmarriage.\n4. Lack of health services: The health care infrastructure of the country had suffered \nfrom underfunding, and health service coverage is less than 50% of the population. \nThe services tend to be urban biased. \nThe combined problem of poor health and inadequate nutrition are likely to have \nlife-long effects on children making them physically unfit, unproductive, mentally \ninactive and less dynamic. Since protein and energy malnutrition affects adult \nworking population, the impact on agricultural production and productivity is likely \nto be high. \nThe lowlands of Ethiopia tend to be infested with tropical diseases like malaria and \nyellow fever that contribute to the sparse population distribution. The major killer \ndiseases accounting for about 75% of all deaths include prenatal-maternal conditions, \nacute respiratory infection, malaria, nutritional deficiency for children under 5 years, \ndiarrhea, AIDS and tuberculosis.

The major factor accelerating the environmental \ndegradation rate is man\u2019s abusive actions such as the removal of the natural vegetation \ncover through deforestation, over-grazing and inappropriate agricultural practices. \nThe population which is growing at a very rapid rate of about 2.6 percent annually has \nbeen clearing forests and vegetation at an alarming rate in order to meet its increasing \nrequirements of food, fiber and energy.\nThe land degradation problem is affecting considerable parts of Ethiopia, especially \nthe highlands, mainly due to water erosion. Soil erosion is the main feature of land \nresource depletion leading to desertification which leads to reduced agricultural \nproduction and shortage of food. Overall, the effects of population pressure and \nresulting environmental degradation have driven the country into widespread food \ninsecurity, drought and famine for the last three decades. The main activities that \nare responsible for environmental degradation in Ethiopia include the removal of \nvegetation cover and over cultivation as a result of the rapidly increasing population \nrequirements for crop production and fuel wood. In addition, overgrazing and high \nlivestock density resulted in the deterioration of rangeland resources.\nActivity 4.10\nIn pairs, discuss the following question. \n1. What are the indirect consequences of deforestation on socio-economic conditions?\nII. Population Growth and Food Production\nThe situation of food in Ethiopia during the last successive three decades is largely \ndominated by a decline in domestic food production. Ethiopian agriculture is \ndominated by small holder peasant farming which contributes about 95% of the \nannual food production of the country. This sector is dependent mainly on traditional \nand subsistent farming methods (with a very limited use of modern technologies) and \nrainfall. Moreover, the rising population pressure and clearing of forests to satisfy its \nbasic demands such as food and energy made the soil susceptible to wind and water \nerosion that can affect both soil fertility and food production in Ethiopia.

Population Growth and Fuel wood Consumption\nThough fuel wood is the most important source of energy in Ethiopia, its supply \nis steadily collapsing in most parts of the country, because it is being collected \nfaster than it can regrow. Increased forest clearance to create farmland, wood for \nconstruction purposes and forage has led to a shortage of fuel wood, deforestation, \nand environmental degradation. The forest cover resource of Ethiopia has been \ndeclining significantly over time. This is caused mainly by rapid population growth \nand the increasing population\u2019s needs for forest resources such as wood and land. \nMany people in the country use wood for cooking, heating, and lightning, as well \nas for houses and furniture. Similarly, the increasing demand for agricultural and \nsettlement lands is a major cause of forest destruction in the country. In Ethiopia, \nthere is a direct correlation between population density and deforestation \u2013 the more \npeople there are in an area, the more trees they cut down.

Is pollution \na problem in your locality?\nWater and air pollution are mainly caused by human activities in households, \nindustries, farmlands, means of transportation, and so on. However, it can also be \ncaused by natural events such as volcanic eruptions, wildfires, and the like. \nWhen an area is overcrowded (i.e. inhabited by a rapidly growing number of \npeople) the natural environment is polluted by a variety of unwanted and harmful \nwastes that peoples\u2019 activities produce. In Ethiopia, pollution is a major problem in \noverpopulated urban centers. In large cities like Addis Ababa, most people live in \nunsafe environments that have extremely polluted air and water. They are surrounded \nby the garbage and pollutants that households, industries, automobiles, and other \nsources discharge.\nIn Ethiopia, rapid population growth leads to environmental pollution by increasing emission of the \namounts of pollutants such as: \n \u00deSewage, solid wastes, and pollutant gases generated by households. \n \u00dePollutant gases, liquids, and solid chemicals generated by expanded industries. \n \u00dePollutant gases generated by the increasing number of automobiles. \n \u00deAgricultural pollutants, such as fertilizers, pesticides, animal wastes, etc.\nFocus \nV.

As a result the products \ngrown are primarily for family needs. This, therefore, leaves little surplus production \nentering the market.\nThe subsistence farming sector of Ethiopia produces varieties of food crops, which \ngrow in different agro-climatic conditions. The crops include cereals such as teff, \nwheat, barley, sorghum, etc. Enset is another major food crop cultivated in parts of \nsouthern, western and central Ethiopia. Pulses and oilseeds are also among the food \ncrops grown in this sector.\nAgriculture in Ethiopia is typically characterized by smallholder and subsistence \nfarming which is highly dependent on rainfall. The urban livelihood is also highly \ndependent on the rural economy and as such small farm constitutes the life support \nmechanism of the country. Most agricultural households in Ethiopia, for example, \nmainly produce for own consumption but also for sale, which can have many purposes \n\u2013 saving, procuring food or non-food items tax or loan repayment. These households \npurchase some of their inputs (fertilizer) and provide some (family labor) from their \nown resources. \nSubsistence farming is the practice of self-sufficiency in which the farmers focus only \non producing enough food for personal consumption. Thus it can play an important \nrole in Ethiopia\u2019s economy by reducing the vulnerability of rural food-insecure \nhouseholds, improving livelihoods. \n5.2.2  Contribution of Cash Crop Production \nto the Ethiopian Economy\nCommercial farming as opposed to the subsistence farming sector, it is concerned \nwith producing crop for sale. Hence, the main objective of this sector is to make \nmoney. In this regard, Ethiopian farmers produce varieties of cash crops such as \ncofee, oilseeds, pulses, chat, sugar cane, cotton and fruit. Contribution of cash crop \nproduction to the Ethiopian economy listed hereunder: \na) Source of Food and Raw Material\nOne of the main roles of agriculture in the Ethiopian economy is being the source \nof food and raw materials. For example, agriculture supplies the country with food \ngrains, dairy and meat products. The agricultural sector is also the supplier of foodstuff \nto consumers and  raw materials to agro- industries"

Contribution to Employment: \nAbout 80% of the Ethiopian population earns their livelihood from agriculture. Cash \ncrops bring substantial wage and employment opportunities to the rural economy .\n5.2.3   Problems of Agriculture  in Ethiopia\nAs discussed in the previous  section agriculture is the mainstay of the Ethiopian \neconomy. The majority of the Ethiopians are farmers but they have not yet secured \nfood at large. The Ethiopian agriculture reveals a picture of virtual stagnation in \nproduction; a rapidly rising population, and declining domestically produced food \nper capita. In other words, because of the instability in agriculture production, \nagriculture has failed to play the decisive role expected of it. The major obstacles to \nthe development of this sector include:\nA. Land degradation\nStudies revealed that because of the topography of the land 50% of the cultivable land \nof Ethiopia is exposed to various levels of soil erosion. The soil in many areas has \nlost some biological productivity and physical properties needed for optimal plant \ngrowth. Land degradation can reduce soil fertility, depth, and essential nutrients and \nwater holding efficiencies  thereby reducing the crop production capacity."

Variable Rainfall  \nIt is a matter of fact that Ethiopian agriculture is heavily dependent upon unreliable \nrainfall which may produce surplus only in years of favourable weather. What is \nmore it has not always been timely. Sometimes it comes early or late. Other times it \nfalls short of the required amount or it falls in excess amount that can highly impact \nboth productivity and food security.\nC. Fragmentation of Farm Plots and Small Size of Holdings\nThe land owned by peasants is getting smaller and smaller over time due to continuous \ndivision of farmland among the number of families in the form of inheritance. The \nagricultural lands are therefore highly fragmented. \nTable 5.2 shows that agricultural land is highly fragmented, the majority (38%) \nof households access less than 0.5 hectares of land, 23.65%  of households access \nbetween 0.51 to 1.0 hectares, 24.04% between 1 and 2 hectares, and that only the \nremaining 14.31% of households access more than 2 hectares of land.

Railways\nThe major advantage of rail transport is that it helps transport bulky products.For \nmore than a century; Ethiopia was served by an international meter gauge railway, \nfrom Addis Ababa to Djibouti. The railway was built from 1897\u20131917 and was about \n781 km long primarily served to move export- imports for a long time. Compared to \nthose of the developed countries the railway was backward. It was also a single lane \ntrack. Eventually, the Ethio-Djibouti Railway and its decades old rolling stock were \nlacking spare parts and were forced to close down over a number of years.\nRecently a new railway line of 752.7 km length connecting Addis Ababa to Djibouti \nwas officially inaugurated in Djibouti in 2018. The Addis Ababa\u2013Djibouti Railway \nis a new standard gauge international railway that serves as the backbone of the \nnew Ethiopian National Railway Network. It provides Ethiopia with access to the \nsea, linking Addis Ababa with Djibouti and its Port of Doraleh. More than 95% of \nEthiopia\u2019s trade passes through Djibouti. The railway line has double-track for 115 \nkm, from Addis Ababa to Adama, and a single track for the remaining 600 km to \nDjibouti. Power is supplied through 20 distribution stations 17 in Ethiopia and 3 in \nDjibouti."

It is the \nfirst light rail and rapid transit in eastern and Sub-Saharan Africa. The total length of \nboth lines (north-south and east-west) of the rail is about 31.6 kilometres, with 39 \nstations. It is estimated that AA-LRT currently transports about 60,000 people daily, \nsignificantly reducing traffic congestion in the capital, Addis Ababa.\nc. Inland Waterways\nWater transport is cheap and convenient for transporting bulky goods over long \ndistances. The use of Ethiopian rivers and lakes as inland waterways is extremely \nlimited. This is due to the ruggedness of the topography and the seasonal nature of \nrainfall in most parts of the country. The only navigable river in Ethiopia is Baro. \nThere is also small-scale transportation over lakes Tana, Abbaya and Ziway. \nd. Air transport\nFor countries like Ethiopia where the topography is difficult for communication, air \ntransport is of special significance. Air transport is the most recent and fastest mode \nof transportation. The Ethiopian Airlines, which is the major airlines in the country, \nis amongst the best airlines by African standards. Ethiopian Airlines (EAL) was \nestablished in 1945. \nEthiopian Airlines is the leading and most \nprofitable airline in Africa. It has more \nthan 62 destinations in Africa and more \nthan 127 international destinations in five \ncontinents. It also has more than 22 \ndomestic destinations and 58 cargo \ndestinations. It is the largest cargo \nnetwork operator in Africa. Ethiopian \nAirlines joined Star Alliance Network, an \ninternational airline network giving it \naccess to more routes with partner \nairlines, in 2011.\nFigure 5.5: Ethiopian airline cargoo transport during Covid 19\nEthiopian Airlines Group has transported 50 million doses of COVID 19 vaccine to \nmore than 28 countries across the globe and became the only African carrier to reach \nsuch a milestone playing crucial role during such a difficult time.

It involves rules such as speed limits and those about \ndrinking and driving, and control systems, such as traffic lights and crossings.\nCurrent Accident Severity Definition in Ethiopia: \n1. A fatal accident is the one in which one or more individuals die as a result \nof a traffic accident within the same reporting 30 days of the occurrence \nof the accident. \n2. A serious injury is one in which a victim sustains severe cuts, bleeding, \nbreaks, and other damages, which requires medical treatment as \u201cin-\npatient\u201d in hospital. \n3. A slight injury is the one as a result of which the victim sustains only small \ncuts, scratches, and other small damages which may be treated as an out-\npatient without requiring admission to a hospital. \n4. Property damage only accident is the one as a result of which no person is \ninjured only one or more vehicles involved in the accident are damaged.\nRoad Traffic Accidents in Ethiopia\nRoad accidents are a global problem affecting all parts of society. However, road safety \nhas received insufficient attention at national and regional levels. As a result, traffic \naccident has been increasing dramatically from time to time.According to the WHO \n(2020) report as a consequence of road traffic accidents, an estimated 1.3 million \npeople die and about 50 million people are injured each year on the world\u2019s roads. \nMost road traffic deaths and injuries occur in low- and middle-income countries. \nEthiopia has experienced high rates of road traffic accidents, as the road is the major \nmeans of transportation. According to official statistics for Ethiopia, road traffic \ndeaths more than doubled in the 12-years between 2007 and 2018, rising from 2,161 \nto 4,597. The size of the vehicle fleet in 2018 was 1,071,345 (see Table 5.6). This \nimplies that nearly 43 people were killed per 10,000 vehicles in the country in 2018. \nViewed from another perspective, Ethiopia loses 13 people per day in road traffic \ncrashes."

In other \nwords, one person is killed on the roads every two hours. It is likely that actual fatality \nfigures in the country are larger than those reported by the Ethiopian Federal Police \nCommission due to factors such as underreporting and misclassification of road \ntraffic fatalities. An integrated crash database is needed to overcome underreporting \nroad traffic crashes.\nAccording to the Federal Police Commission (2019) report distribution of road traffic \ncrashes in the country is uneven, with road fatalities and injuries concentrated on \nroads in the central part of the country. For instance, four out of 12 regional States, \nnamely the Oromia, Amhara, South Nations Nationality People regions, and the Addis \nAbaba City Administration accounted for almost 85 % of the fatalities in the country. \nFactors Influencing Road Accidents\nThere are four major factors influencing road traffic accidents.

It also refers to the wider natural world of land, sea, and atmosphere. \nHumans have been interacting with their environment since people began to live on \nthe Earth. For example, humans have been cutting forests to grow crops for centuries \nand by doing so we altered the environment. Conversely, the environment affects \nhumans in many different ways as well. A simple example is the way we change our \nclothes in response to cold or hot weather.  \nA good climate, accessible clean water, fertile soil, etc. are aspects of the physical \nenvironment that enable people to live and thrive. However, harsh environments, \nsuch as a very hot or cold climate, limited water, and infertile land, make it more \ndifficult for people to survive. Humans are also affected by major environmental \nevents such as earthquakes, floods and drought that damage homes, property and \nagriculture. These can lead to the displacement of people and can cause injury, loss of \nlife and destruction of livelihoods. They can also damage water sources and pipelines, \ncausing water contamination and spreading waterborne diseases. \nThe relationship between human being and environment can be seen in three ways \nnamely; dependence, modification and adaptation.

Dependence on the Environment\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 How human being is dependent on physical environment? \nEvery single living thing on this planet is dependent on the environment it lives in. \nWhether it is for air, water, food, or shelter, living beings simply cannot survive \nwithout some form of interaction. Basically, everything you see around you is entirely \ndependent on environmental resources that come from thousands of miles away .\nB. Modification of the Environment\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 How can human modify his/her environment? \nHuman activities frequently result in environmental change, both with negative \nand positive results.Even the most ecologically sustainable farming methods and \nrenewable energy projects require resources provided by nature. Human beings use \nincreasing amounts of land to build homes, shopping centers, and schools. \nC. Adaptation to the Environment\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527    How human beings adapt the environment?\nPeople seem to live in the strangest places on this planet, which is partly due to \nincreased knowledge of the environment. The more successful species are able \nto adapt to changes in their environment, the more likely they are to survive. For \nexample, there are people who live in different climatic regions such as the Arctic, \ndeserts and dense forest regions. It proves how humans are adapted to the natural \nenvironment. \nThe links between human activities and the environment are complex and varied, but \ncan be grouped into two main types of activities:\n \u00deuse of natural resources such as land, food, water, soils, minerals, plants \nand animals, and \n \u00deproduction of wastes from a range of activities including agriculture, \nindustry and mining, as well as wastes from our bodies. \n1)  Use of natural resources\nWe use many different types of natural resources in our daily lives. We depend on \nfood and water for survival and we need energy for many different purposes, from \ndomestic cooking through to major industrial processes. Our clothes, transport, "

Let us take a simple example. Think of the resources that have been \nused to produce a notebook of the type you may be using right now as you study this \nsubject. Manufacturing the paper needed raw materials of wood and water as well \nas energy for its production process. The trees that supplied the wood required soil, \nwater and land to grow on. There may be ink or metal staples or other components in \nyour notebook that were made from other types of resources. Our need for resources \nis vast and it is growing as the population and consumption per person increases with \nsocio-economic progress. \nGlobally, both population and resource extraction increased by almost 50% in the 25 \nyears from 1980 to 2005. Over that time, the world population increased from 4.44 \nbillion in 1980 to 7.8 billion in 2020. Metals are used in the manufacture of wide \nranges of goods \u2013 from cars to computers. Minerals are used in industrial processes \nand in construction to build houses and roads. Both metallic and non-metallic minerals \nare obtained from rocks that have been mined and are then processed in various ways \nto extract valuable resource. \nNatural resource extraction shows a steady increase from 1980 to 2005, with the \ngreatest amount extracted in the most recent years. The most likely reason is the \nincrease in the global population in this period; more people need more resources. \nIt could also be the case that the amount used by individuals and by wider society is \nincreasing due to changes in behavior and levels of consumption. \nAdvances in technology have increased natural resource exploitation by enabling \npeople to reach new resources and to exploit more resources per capita.  For example, \nfishermen who use traditional technologies such as small boats are limited in the \nnumber of fish they catch. Modern industrial fishing fleets use very large ships that \ncover huge areas of the ocean at greater depths to catch many more fish. This can lead \nto overfishing, which means catching fish at a faster rate than they can reproduce.  \nOverfishing and other examples of over-exploitation of natural resources can result \nin damage to or the loss of entire ecosystems. An ecosystem includes all the living \norganisms (humans, plants, animals, micro-organisms) and their physical environment \n(soil, water, air, land) and the interactions between them. If one component of the \nsystem is removed, this can have knock-on effects on the other parts of the system."

            "text": "  Grade 9 | Geography \n164I. Use of Forest Resources \nOne particular problem caused by over-exploitation of forest resources is deforestation, \nwhich occurs when forest areas are cleared and the trees are not replanted or allowed \nto regrow. In Ethiopia, clearing land for agriculture to meet the food needs of the \ngrowing population and the demand for fuel and construction materials has resulted \nin a steady loss of forest area, which is continuing as you can see from Figure 6.1. \nbelow. \nFigure 6.1: Proportion of Land area in Ethiopia Covered by Forest (%) (2002-\n2011).   Source: MoFED, 2012a)\nThe loss of forests has several undesirable consequences. Forests are home to many \ndifferent types of trees, as well as other plants, and a wide range of animals from \ninsects to birds and mammals. The conversion of forest lands to agriculture greatly \nreduces biodiversity, which is a measure of the variety of living organisms (all life \nforms). Biodiversity is important for humans because we use other living organisms \nto provide several essentials like: \n \u00deFood: we use plants and animals such as fish, goats, wheat, rice, and maize \nas sources of food. \n \u00deMedicines: many traditional medicines are made from plants and animals \nand new medicines are developed from them as well. \n \u00deEcological services: living organisms, especially plants and microorganisms, \nplay an important role in processes that maintain our lives and environment \nsuch as providing oxygen, cleaning the air, purifying water, breaking down \nwastes and controlling erosion.

Once the trees and \nundergrowth are removed, the underlying ground is exposed. Without the intercepting \neffect of the vegetation and the tree roots binding the soil together, the soil is more \nlikely to be washed away when it rains. Loss of forests also has a significant impact \non water supply. Tree roots reach deep into the soil and create spaces between \nthe particles which increases soil permeability, allowing rainwater to soak in and \nreplenish groundwater. \nII. Energy Resources\nThe use of renewable or non-renewable resources is a critical factor when considering \nenergy resources. Fossil fuels have been the main energy source for global \nindustrialization, but because they are non-renewable, the quantity is ultimately \nlimited and their use is not sustainable over the long term. Furthermore, the burning \nof fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change. There are several renewable \nalternatives to fossil fuels. The wood used as a fuel is renewable in the sense that \ntrees will regrow but there are other disadvantages such as deforestation, as you have \nread. In Ethiopia, wind farms are harnessing wind power to generate electricity but \nthe most important source of renewable energy in Ethiopia is water. Ethiopia already \nhas several hydroelectric power stations and more are planned, including the Grand \nEthiopian Renaissance Dam, currently under construction. Hydroelectric power is \nrenewable because it makes use of the energy of flowing water but does not use \nup the water in the process. Another renewable energy source is solar power, using \nphotovoltaic cells that convert the sun\u2019s energy into electricity. \nIII. Water Resources\nThe direct use of water falls into three main categories: \n \u00dedomestic uses, including drinking, washing and cooking;\n \u00deagricultural uses, principally irrigation; and\n \u00deindustrial uses, in manufacturing processes and for energy generation.\nThe relative proportions of these three categories vary in different parts of the world, \nbut globally the sector using the most water is agriculture."

(Adapted from F AO, 2012)\nIn addition to direct use of water for human activities, it is also essential for the \nenvironment to maintain biodiversity. Rivers, lakes and wetlands are important \nhabitats for wildlife and need a certain amount of water at all times to function \nproperly within the system. This becomes a problem when the demand for water for \nhuman activities exceeds the supply.\nWater is not an endlessly renewable resource. In many parts of the world water \ndemand is significantly above sustainable water supply. Sustainable water supply \nmeans there are adequate supplies, in both quality and quantity, to meet the current \nand future needs of people and of the environment. \nMany countries are already experiencing water stress or scarcity. These terms refer to \nthe volume of water available relative to the use and demand for it, which is linked to \nthe population served. Countries, which have less than 1700 m3 of water per person \nper year for all purposes are defined as water stressed. Water-scarce countries have \nbeen defined as those with less than 1000 m3 of water per person per year.

Waterborne diseases are caused by pathogens \n(disease-causing agents) in water and food that has been contaminated by the wastes \nfrom infected people. \nIndustry, agriculture and energy production all generate wastes that can pollute the air, \nwater and soil.

What do you think about \nthe population of Ethiopia?\nOverpopulation occurs when there is an excess of population over utilized or potential \nresources. It may result from an increase in population, a decline in resources, a \ndecline in the demand for labor, or a combination of these factors. In other words, \noverpopulation may take place where resource development does not go hand in hand \nwith population growth, and where growth of tertiary services lags behind technical \nprogress.\nAbsolute overpopulation may be distinguished from relative overpopulation, the \nformer occurring where the absolute limit of production has been attained though \nliving standards remain low, while the latter indicates that present production is \ninadequate for the population although greater production is feasible. Relative \noverpopulation is more common than absolute overpopulation.\nOverpopulation may be found at various levels: rural, industrial, regional, national. \nRural overpopulation is common but is most striking in populous underdeveloped \nareas. In South-East Asia, where there is high fertility and declining mortality, \nintensive agriculture, land fragmentation and minimal mechanization, natural checks \nto overpopulation have exercised great control in the past. The demographic evolution \nof China has been frequentlyinterrupted by famines, floods, droughts and epidemics. \nRural overpopulation may also result from \na)  uneven distribution of land among farmers, \nb)  increased mechanization and reduced demand for agricultural laborers,\nc)  a change from cultivation to livestock farming and again reduced demand \nfor labor, and \nd)  rapid rural population growth. \nMany ofthese features can be seen in old countries of Europe.Famine,hunger, \nprolonged unemployment and increase of landless laborers and beggars as symptoms \nof rural overpopulation. Unfortunately, solutions otherthan emigration are slow \nand difficult, but in the long-run social and cultural revolutions are more effective. \nInvariably overpopulation expresses itself only at the lowest levels of society: rural \noverpopulation affects the landless and the smallholders; industrial overpopulation \nhits the unskilled and semi-skilled workers."

What are the causes of underpopulation? \nUnder population may be said to exist where a population is too small to utilize \nfully its resources, or where the resources could support a larger population without \nlowering living standards or increasing unemployment. The former is more frequent \nthan the latter.\nAbsolute underpopulation is quite rare, save in the case of isolated population where \nnumbers are incapable of normal demographic replacement of adequate economic \nproduction. Relative under-population takes place where there is insufficient \ndevelopment of the resources available; nowhere is it more common than in the \nsouthern continents.\nUnder population is when there are more resources in an area (for example, food, \nenergy and minerals) than can be used by the people living there. Under population is \nwhen a region or country has insufficient workers to exploit their resources efficiently, \nto support retired population and to provide growth. Therefore, too few people use \nall the resources of an area to the maximum efficiency. The number of people is not \nsufficient to utilize the resources of the country, the resources are vast, much can be \nproduced, but men are not sufficient. Most areas considered under-populated today \nare large in area and rich in resources. These countries can export the surplus of food, \nenergy, and mineral resources, have high incomes, good living conditions and level \nof technology and immigration. This phenomenon results in a decline in population. \nWith fewer people, there is a decrease in demands for services. \nThe impacts of under-population include: shortage of workforce, fewer people to pay \ntaxes etc. "

One of the largest environmental effects of human \npopulation growth is the problem of global warming. Some scientists fear that global \nwarming will lead to rising sea levels and extreme weather conditions in the future. \nIn order to support the growing population, forests are being destroyed at an alarming \nrate. Humans also continue to put a great demand on the natural resources of our \nplanet. Many non-renewable resources are being depleted due to the unrestrained \nuse of fuel and energy. Many parts of the world also suffer from a shortage of food \nand water. The growth of population puts demands on our already limited resources. \nThe environment on earth is suffering from the growth of global population. The \ndepletion of resources and biodiversity, the production of waste, and the destroying \nof natural habitats are serious problems that must be addressed in order to ensure that \nlife on earth will be sustainable throughout the next century.\nPhysical environment means nonliving environment or the land, air, water, soil \nand minerals. The utilization, overuse and misuse of physical resources increased \nmanifold due to the growth of human population. As it has been discussed earlier, more \npopulation means more mouths to feed which requires more agricultural production. \nAccordingly, more cultivable land has been made available by clearing forests and by \nreclaiming wetland, ponds and green belts. Feeding the growing population requires \nmore advances in agriculture that in turn requires the utilization of more water, more \nfertilizers and more pesticides.\nIt is clear that the growing population demands more space to construct houses and \navailability of more consumer goods. It also requires more means of transport, more \nconsumption of fossil fuels and more pollutants of air, land and water. Thus, the \ngrowth of population leads to pollution of air, land and water. To this effect, different \ntypes of pollutions are causing many problems in the physical environment that are \nfurther affecting the biological environment seriously.\nEthiopia is the most populous country in Africa with a higher rate of population \ngrowth. Its population was estimated to be over 101 million by 2016 and currently \ngrowing at a rate of 2.6%. The majority of the population are making their livelihoods \nin lands that are now categorized as moderately to severely degraded areas; mostly \nin the Ethiopian highlands. Unless significant conservation measures are set out \nand implemented accordingly, many of the moderately degraded lands might be \nrigorously degraded in the future. This often becomes the underlining cause for over-\nexploitation of the natural resources and subsequent environmental degradations\nAs has been discussed earlier, the size of Ethiopia\u2019s population has been growing very "

Deforestation\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 What is deforestation? Can you mention some of the problems caused by \ndeforestation? Is deforestation a problem in your locality?\nDeforestation refers to the removal of forest cover of an area without adequate \nreplacement. In other words, it is the process of the indiscriminate destruction of the \nnatural vegetation cover of a forest area.\nRemoval of forest has several consequences. Among these, the most important \none is the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which inturn results global \nwarming.  During photosysnthesis plants absorb carbondioxide and release oxygen \nin which all heterotrophs can depend upon it.  Such circulation and interdepence can \nbe disrupted by deforestation and finally result other species of biodiversity will be \naffected negatively. \nThe forest cover resources of Ethiopia have been declining significantly over time. \nThis is caused mainly by rapid population growth and the increasing population\u2019s \nneeds for forest resources such as fuel wood and land. Many people in the country \nuse wood for cooking, heating, and lightening, as well as for houses and furniture. \nSimilarly, the increasing demand for agricultural and settlement lands is a major cause \nof forest destruction in the country. In Ethiopia, there is a direct correlation between \npopulation density and deforestation \u2013 the more people there are in an area, the more \ntrees they cut down. New trees do not spring up to replace the old ones.\nIn Ethiopia, rapid population growth leads to deforestation mainly because of people\u2019s \nincreasing needs for more:\n \u00dewood\n \u00deagricultural land \u00desettlement land\n \u00degrazing land"

Encroachment of farmland \nand pasture into the natural forests had also been a common practice in many parts \nof Ethiopia. Such deforestation activities and overgrazing have led to soil erosion \nresulting in land quality deterioration, biodiversity loss, and impact on the overall \nclimate system posing a serious problem in every aspect of human life\nII. Pollution\nThe term \u2018pollution\u2019 refers to any undesirable substance added or contaminated to \nenvironmental resources which are hazardous or potentially hazardous to human \nhealth, safety, and welfare or risky to the normal functioning of other living creatures. \nPollution refers to any undesirable change in natural conditions of water, air, and \nother components of the natural environment that has negative effects on the health \nand activities of human beings and other living creatures.\n Environmental pollution is any change within the environment that affects the \nintegrity of an ecosystem. In most cases, such changes are caused by the action \nof human beings mainly due to urbanization, industrialization, construction and \ntransportation activities, agricultural and land use management practices. Because \nof various unwanted substances released to the environment, the majority of natural \nresources have been affected, many destroyed and a large portion of it falls under \nimmense threat.\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 Can you mention some of the causes of air and water pollution? Is pollution \na problem in your locality?\nWater and air pollution are mainly caused by human activities in households, \nindustries, farmlands, means of transportation, and so on. However, it can also be \ncaused by natural events such as volcanic eruptions, wildfire, and the like.\nWhen an area is overcrowded (i.e. inhabited by a rapidly growing number of people)  \nthe  natural  environment  is  polluted  by  a  variety  of  unwanted  and harmful \nwastes that peoples\u2019 activities produce. In Ethiopia, pollution is a major problem in \noverpopulated urban centers. In large cities like Addis Ababa, most people live in \nunsafe environments that have extremely polluted air and water. They are surrounded \nby the garbage, and pollutants that households, industries, automobiles, and other \nsources discharge. \nPractically in Ethiopia, the agriculture sector is found to be the major source of \nenvironmental pollution.

This has \ncaused air pollution which continuously affects human health, and also triggers \nglobal warming. In such cases, indoor air pollution from biomass fuel is responsible \nfor 50,320 annual under-5-year children deaths accounting for 4.9% of the national \nburden of disease in the country.\nAt the same time, pollution due to emissions from motor traffic and industrialization \nprocesses have also their share in polluting the environment. Chemical wastes and \nbyproducts from industries and unmanaged urban waste disposal from major cities in \nopen landfill sites are continuously polluting the environment. For instance, many of \nthe leather processing industries in Ethiopia lack proper waste treatment methods. By \nits very nature, leather processing involves soaking, fleshing, washing, etc. to remove \ndirt, flesh, salt, and other foreign substances by making use of water .\nAs a result, different things like salt, pesticides, flesh, hair, suspended solids, sulfate, \nammonia, base, chlorides, acid, and other oxygen demanding substances might be \nreleased into the surrounding water bodies.\nGenerally, in Ethiopia, rapid population growth leads to environmental pollution by \nincreasing emission of the amounts of pollutants such as:\n \u00deSewage, solid wastes, and pollutant gases generated by households.\n \u00dePollutant gases, liquids, and solid chemicals generated by expanded \nindustries.\n \u00dePollutant gases generated by the increasing number of automobiles.\n \u00deAgricultural pollutants, such as fertilizers, pesticides, animal wastes, etc\nIII. Land/Soil Degradation\nThe land serves as storage for water and nutrients required for plants and other living \nmicro-macro-organisms. The demand for food, energy and other human requirements \ndepends upon the preservation and improvement of the productivity of land. The loss \nof arable land has been caused by a number of factors, many or most of which are \ntied to human development. The primary causes are deforestation, overexploitation \nfor fuelwood, overgrazing, agricultural activities and industrialization.\nLand degradation involves both soil erosion and loss of soil fertility; hence, \nmeasurements of land degradation usually focus on the severity of soil erosion. \nEthiopia with high-intensity rainstorms and extensive steep slopes, is highly \nsusceptible to soil erosion, especially in thehigh  lands. Erodibility also depends on "

In the \ncountry, degradation of land stems from the historical development of agriculture and \nhuman settlement in the highland regions. Recent estimates using satellite imagery \nshows that land degradation hotspots over the last three decades cover about 23% \nof the land area in the country, basically in large areas of Tigray, Wollo, and Gondar \namong others. \nThe factors influencing soil erosion and, therefore, land degradation are multiple and \nmutually reinforcing. As indicated earlier, the massive removal of vegetative cover \nis the driving force behind land degradation. This loss is largely due to an expanding \npopulation, with its corresponding increased demand for crops, grazing land, and fuel \nwood. The removal of vegetative cover for use as fodder and fuel leads to an increase \nin surface runoff and, thus, to higher soil erosion. With the removal of top soil (a \nreduction in soil depth), there is less root anchor  age for plants. In addition, there is a \nloss of soil nutrients anda reduction in water holding capacity.\nWhen animal dung and crop residues are used for household fuel rather than recycled \ninto the soil, the soil loses nutrients and organic matter. As the fuel wood scarcity \ngrows worse, women and children have to collect fuel wood from more distant \nsources and substitute more and more dung and crop residues for household fuel. In \nthe intensively farmed rural areas as well as in the drought-prone degraded areas of \nthe north and the east, cattle dung has already largely replaced wood as the primary \nhousehold energy source. All of these factors combined lead to a reduction in crop \nproductivity.They also contribute to crop failure, reduced cropping intensity, and \ndecreased resistance to drought. This induces further land clearing and reinforces \nthe vicious cycle of land degradation. As soil depth is reduced, croplands revert to \ngrassland and ultimately to bare rock."

Soil erosion is a \nnatural process that removes soil from the land. However, human activities frequently \naggravate this process.\nFactors that accelerate soil erosion in Ethiopia can be divided into two: natural and \nhuman-made.\nI. Natural Factors \nIt involve a combination of the following natural factors: steepness of slope \n(Topography), the intensity, duration and seasonality of rainfall, soil type (example, \ntexture), torrent rivers during the summer and vegetation cover.\nII. Human-made Factors: \nHere are some of the many ways in which people have contributed to the erosion of \nthe land that they depend on.\n\uf0a7\tDeforestation: Most of the highlands of Ethiopia were once covered \nby forests. These forests provide habitats for animals and livelihood for \nhumans; they also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and \nmitigate climate change. Deforestation is progressing at a rapid rate and \nhas become one of the main causes of Ethiopia\u2019s hastened erosion rate.\n\uf0a7\tOvergrazing (keeping too many livestock a small spatial unit):  \nMost areas used for pastoral activities are overgrazed because too many \nanimals have been kept there relative to their grass. The livestock destroys \nthe vegetation faster than it can replenish itself. When the vegetation is \ndestroyed, the land is laid bare and is therefore vulnerable to erosion. \nAmong domestic animals goats are particularly damaging. They destroy \nall kinds and parts of an area\u2019s vegetation, including the roots.\n\uf0a7\tBad cultivation practices: Bad cultivation practices also speed up \nerosion by making the soil vulnerable to the natural forces that we have \njust described a few lines above. For example,\no Over cropping \u2013 It is the act of planting an area too densely. This \napproach to farming uses up the soil\u2019s nutrients faster than natural \nprocesses can replenish them and destroys the land\u2019s fertility."

In farming, this practice is sometimes used periodically to \nstrip an area before leaving it to lie fallow to regain its nutrients. \nHowever, since the soil is now bare and therefore unprotected, \nthe land is vulnerable to the forces of erosion.

However, these \nresources are under the influence of various interconnected factors like population \npressure, agricultural expansion, migration, rapid urbanization, resettlement, \nclimate change, and environmental pollution that result in serious degradation.\n \ud83c\udf0dThe major problem of Ethiopia\u2019s soils is erosion by running water. Both human-\nmade and natural factors are responsible for erosion. Attempts have been underway \nto check erosion through reforestation, afforestation, terracing, constructing check \ndams, plugging gullies, contour ploughing, strip cultivation, etc.\n \ud83c\udf0dLong term human occupation of the highlands of Ethiopia, accompanied by \nsedentary agriculture and extensive cattle herding activities, in combination with \npopulation pressure have resulted in the heavy deforestation, and subsequent wild \nanimals extinction. The forest resource stock that had covered 40 percent of the \ncountry has come to less than 3 percent these days. However, due to the recently \nadopted Ethiopian government strategy known as \u201cGreen Legacy\u201d, the forest \narea coverage has been raised up to about 15.7%, as indicated by National Forest \nInventory report of 2018.\n \ud83c\udf0dHence, the Ethiopian government has taken several steps to address these \nproblems like launching soil and water conservation campaign, tree planting \nprograms, developing water resources conservation and management policy and \nothers. Moreover, awareness has been created at all levels through school syllabi \nand extension services to mitigate the problem."

For \ninstance, men and women sketched their routes to hunting, fishing and gathering \ngrounds. Today, we also prepare maps, for many purposes. However, map-making \nhas passed through many stages of development since its beginning. The two main \nstages of the historical development of map-making are: \na)  Traditional map-making\nb)  Modern map-making\nA. Traditional Map Making\nThe art of traditional map-making is as old as the human race. Traditional maps have \nbeen made in many ways. For example, early map materials included sticks, shells, \nclay tablets, parchment, paper, and solid plates of silver. Many traditional maps were \nlocational. For example, they have shown the locations of water holes and hunting \ngrounds and have included paths that led to these places.\nIn traditional map-making, collecting measurements of distances, directions, areas and locations was \none of the greatest challenges. Each measurement was being made by hand, through fieldwork in \nthe area being mapped. This process was laborious and tiresome. Often the accuracy of the resulting \ninformation is imperfect and therefore not fully dependable.\nFocus \nAnother main difference between traditional and modern maps is that a traditional map \nmight include drawings of three-dimensional objects. As a result, a traditional map \nmight besomewhat pictographic (or physiographic) rather than strictly diagrammatic.\nB. Modern Map Making\nModern scientific mapping has its roots in the 17th century. Several developments \nduring the Renaissance gave impetus to accurate map-making (cartography). \nFurthermore, advancements in science and technology resulted in the invention of \nbetter cameras and airplanes specially designed to take aerial photographs. Today, \nmap-makers have diverse opportunities to acquire spatial information. In addition to \naerial photography, satellite imagery provides a wealth of information."

What are the major uses of \nmaps?\nMaps are used for identifying locations, distance, area and direction.\nLocation: A map shows the exact site of a place as well as the general situation \nrelative to other areas. For example, Ethiopia\u2019s location can be expressed \nin terms of its neighbouring countries, external land masses and water \nbodies. It is also possible to locate a place using astronomical grid \nreferences \u2013 parallels and meridians. \nDistance: With the help of a map, we can measure the distance between places. \nThis is done by using the scale of the map. For example, the air distance \nbetween Hawassa and Addis Ababa can be calculated by using a map of \nEthiopia.\nArea: the size of a certain place, a country, a region, a continent can be calculated \nfrom a map. This is done by measuring the length and the width of the \ngiven place on the map and by converting them to ground distances with \nthe help of the scale of the map.\nDirection: A map can enable us to identify the direction and bearing of any place on \nthe map. This is accomplished by referring to another place"

The map legend explains the meaning of the signs and \nsymbols used in the map.\nDate/Year of publication: it identifies the year in which the map was published. \nBecause this information tells you how old the map is, you might be able \nto judge whether the map\u2019s contents are current or might be out of date."

Simple Line Graph\n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 What is a line graph?\nA line graph uses lines to show changes over time. It is also used to show the \nrelationship between two sets of information/phenomena. The line graph shown in \nFigure 8.14, illustrates the data presented in Table 8.2. It shows the changes in the \npopulation size of Ethiopia from 1900 to 2020. In the graph, the x-axis represents \nyears, and the y-axis represents population size. Steps used to draw a line graph: \n1. The horizontal axis is normally used to represent an independent variable, i.e. time, \nwhile the vertical axis represent  a dependent variable, \n2. The base of the vertical scale should be at zero, and the top should be slightly higher \nthan the maximum value to be recorded on it. \n3. When ploting the graph use small crosses or dots to mark values.\nTable 8.4: Growth of the Ethiopian Population (1950-2020)\nYear 1950 1960 1970 1980 1990 2000 2010 2020\nPopulation \nin (Million)19.2 23.5 29.5 37.7 51.2 63.4 87.6 114.9\n            Figure 8.15: Growth of the Ethiopian Population (1950 - 2020)"

Simple Bar Graph \n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 What is a bar graph?\nA bar graph is another graphical tool for displaying statistical data. It uses horizontal \nor vertical bars to show different amounts of the same item or different values for the \nsame phenomenon. The heights or lengths of the bars on a graph are proportional to \nthe quantities they represent. Such a graph might show how amounts or values differ \nfrom place to place or as they change over time.\nFor example, a bar graph can be used to show how rainfall varies from month to \nmonth in a certain place. The following bar graph has been prepared based on the \ndata given in Table 8.3. It shows the monthly distribution of rainfall in Kokosa town \nWest Arsi Zone of Ethiopia. \n. Steps used to draw a simple bar graph:\n1. The horizontal scale usually represents the independent variable, more specifically \nwhen the time element is of significant, such as when graphing mean monthly rainfall \nor annual production. \n2. All bars must start at zero and bar graphs are drawn for the purposes of comparison \nmust be drawn on the same scale. \n3. When vertical bars are drawn, the time sequence should be from left to right. \n4. The width of the bar is a matter of choice. However, avoid bars that are too thick or \ntoo thin. \n5. The value of each bar can be assessed more easily if  space or gap is left between each \nbar.\nCompare a single feature as it exists in different places or as it changes over time. \nFor example, they can represent such statistical data as annual rainfall distribution on \na monthly basis. The mean monthly distribution of rainfall in Kokosa town can be \nshown as follows. NB The graph in Figure 8.15 below has been drawn using the data \ngiven in Table 8.5."

Pie Chart \n /u1f469_1f3fd_200d_1f527 What is a pie chart? What are they used for? \nPie charts are circle graphs. They use segments of the circle to show the sizes of \nthe items that make up its subject. The segments are shaped like the slices of a pie. \nThe circle of the chart represents the total (100%). The segments represent parts \nof the whole. The size of each segment is proportional to the size of the part that it \nrepresents. \nPie charts are primarily used to \n \u00deShow the sizes of parts in relation to a single whole. \n \u00deShow the sizes of those parts in relation to each other.\nOften, pie charts also emphasize one or more significant elements in the data."

Then, \nthe same data appears as a pie chart in Figure 8.17. \nPie charts use segments of a circle to show the percent of export destination that \nmake up a data series. Steps used to draw a pie chart:\n1. The circle can be of any convenient size depending upon the available space for \ndrawing. \n2. The circle is divided into segments which are proportional to the value of the \nindividual components calculated as a percentage of the total and, 1% of the whole \ncircle is equivalent to 3.6% of the value of an item or data component.
