It tells what they did and what happened to them. Historians are people who study and write about the human past. They tell us that history began about 5,500 years ago when people first began to write.  \nHowever, the study of human past begins in prehistory. Prehistory is the study of the  \ndistant past. Prehistory was the time before people developed the art of writing.   \nArchaeologists and Anthropologists have worked to find clues about early human life.\nOnly a small part is studied of these events and deeds of the past. This small part, which \nis studied, is also called history. Unlike prehistory, however, the subject of history  \nmainly deals with the past, beginning from when writing and recording started. \nHistory is about human interaction, the growth of civilizations, the invention of \nnew technology, man\u2019s relationship with the environment etc. One of the significant  \nconcerns of history is the study of humans\u2019 interaction with the natural environment in the past. However, the other disciplines do it in the present. Man interacts with the natural  \nenvironment to produce his primary needs, such as food, shelter, and cloth. In the  \nproduction process, human beings improved the production tools and the quality and quantity of the produce.Brainstorming\n\u2022\tDiscuss in group prehistory and history.Lesson learning outcomes \nAt the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:\n\u2022\tdefine the discipline of History.\n\u2022\texplain  the difference between prehistory and history"

Historical fact refers to information or statement about the past that is known or proven to be true. History is all about providing an interpretation of what happened, why it happened, and how it happened based on sources.  Therefore, history is both the facts of the past and inquiry made into the past facts. Thus, history is not an opinion or novel writing. \nIdentifying historical facts from opinion requires critical thinking. Distinguishing between \nfact and opinion is one of the most important skills you can learn from studying history.  A fact is a statement that can be proved with supporting information. On the other hand, an opinion is what a writer believes based on his or her viewpoint. History writers can keep their opinions with facts, but an opinion is something that cannot be proved.\n1.\u2002How can you distinguish facts from opinion? Explain it by giving an  \n     example.\n1.2 The Discipline of History \nLesson learning outcomes\nAt the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:\n\u2022\tdescribe the importance of learning history.\n\u2022\tidentify different sources of history.\n\u2022\texamine pieces of historical sources closely.\n\u2022\tappreciate the role of history in understanding societal development. \n\u2022\tdiscuss the level of accuracy of data obtained from other sources. \uf03f\uf03f"

It studies changes in the development of past societies\u2019 political, economic, social, and cultural life.\n1.2.1  The Importance of History\nHistory helps us know about the past, understand the present, and foresee future  \ndevelopments. It also allows us to understand national and international issues, including democratic principles and nationalism. History can also help us develop the necessary skill for collecting and analysing information to reach conclusions. So, it helps us live our lives as conscious citizens actively participating in shaping our future. \nHistory teaches us critical skills. Studying History helps students to develop essential \nresearch skills. History helps us understand the present better and provides a sense of identity. \n1.2.2 Historiography and Historical Interpretations\nA. Historiography Historiography studies how knowledge of the past is attained and transmitted. The world\u2019s oldest written History comes from China. Archaeologists have discovered  \nrecords of Chinese History written before 1000 BC. Ancient Greek historians, notably  \nHerodotus and Thucydides, introduced the organized study and narration of the past. The term\u2019s  first use is attributed to Herodotus (c. 484-425 BC), who is often the \u201cfather of history. \u201d Thucydides wrote critically and accurately.  \nHistory emerged as an academic discipline in the second half of the 19\nth century, first \nin Europe and then other parts of the world. Leopold V on Ranke (1795-1886), the  \nGerman historian, established History as an independent discipline. Ranke is considered the  \n \u201cfather of modern historiography\u201d for his effort to the scientific study of the past. \nEthiopia had an indigenous tradition of history writing. It made some changes from the chronicle tradition in the early 20\nth century. History emerged as an academic discipline in \nthe 1960s. This decade is vital in the growth of Ethiopian historiography.\nB. Historical Interpretation \nWhat happened in the past is endless. Thus, historians select topics or problems they  \ndesire to study. History is a systematic and objective study of the past as a field of  Brainstorming\n\u2022\tHow can we study history?"

It is a systematic study because historical study follows established rules,  \nprocedures, and standards. Historians use specific basic methods in writing History. The \nstudy of History also refers to the objective pursuit of truth. In principle, historians are  \nexpected to avoid bias though it is difficult in practice. Historical interpretation is the process by which we describe, analyse, evaluate, and create an explanation of past events. We base our  \ninterpretation on primary or secondary, or both sources.\n1.2.3 Sources of History\nHistory is the study of the past supported by evidence arising from sources. Where there are no sources, there is no history. Sources are, therefore, key to the study  and  writing  of  History. Most commonly, historians divide sources into two broad groups. These are primary and secondary.  \nPrimary sources are those that are contemporary with the events under study. They are \noriginal materials that have direct relations to the events they describe. Examples of  \nprimary sources are Monuments, tools, ornaments, artifacts (coins, fossils,  \ninscriptions, weapons, utensils, and ruins of buildings), written materials (manuscripts or handwritten materials, chronicles, diaries, letters, minutes, codes of laws, court records and  \nadministrative files, travel documents), photographs, maps, video and audiovisual  \nmaterials.\n                   a)         b)\nFigure 1.1   a) Silver Coins of Enudybis, b) Archives\nSecondary sources are sources that contain information that is derived from  \nprimary sources. In addition, they provide us with second-hand or indirect information.  \nExamples of secondary sources are articles, books, textbooks, biographies, oral  \ntraditions and published stories or movies about historical events.Oral traditions are  \nhistorical sources transmitted by word of mouth from one generation to the next.  \nHistory can only be written based on data collected from the abovementioned sources. However, whatever the source of information, it should be subjected to critical evaluation \n"

Secondary sources have to be examined for the reliability of their reconstructions. Oral data should be cross-checked with other sources such as written documents to determine its  truth; because  it  may lose its authenticity due to distortion through time.\n1.2.4  Dating in History \nIn recording the past, historians try to determine the exact time when events occurred. That is what we call it dating. Dating is figures or numerical statements that express the time of historical events or processes. The duration in time could be short or long. There -\nfore, historians describe the period of events by using certain subdivisions or units of time. Hence, the figurative expression expresses the exact dates on which events occurred. For example:\n\u2022\tthe battle of Adwa took place on March 1, 1896 \n\u2022\tEthiopian Renaissance Dam was initiated on April 2, 2011. 1.\u2002Explain why we bother about the past while living in the present and  \n     anticipate what is yet to come.\n2.\u2002In a group, search the importance of learning history from the internet   \n     and present it to the class.3.\u2002Answer the following question based on the below case study.

You were  \nprovided with information about it from the following sources. The first is the driver of the car and a passenger who was in the vehicle during the car accident. The second is parents of whom a victim had talked to them just before death and a police report with possible details. \nA.

A decade refers to a period of ten years. A century is one hundred years, \nwhereas a millennium refers to a thousand years. For example:\n\u2022\tThe years from 1900 to 1909 are the first decade of the twentieth century .  \n\u2022\tThe years from 1900 to 1999 are the twentieth century.\n\u2022\tThe years from 1000 to 1999 are the second millennium. \nThe primary purpose of dating in history is to organise past events according to their  \nsequence of occurrence by using calendars. This is what we call chronology. The two widely used calendars worldwide are the Gregorian and Islamic. According to the  \nGregorian calendar, time is counted forward and backwards from the time of the birth of Jesus Christ. The time before the birth of Christ is referred to as BC (Before Christ), whereas the time after the birth of Jesus Christ is expressed in AD (anno Domini), a Latin term meaning \u201cThe Year of the Lord\u201d. \nEthiopia uses its calendar and periodization. The Ethiopian Calendar is seven to eight \nyears behind the Gregorian calendar. The Islamic Calendar follows the event called the Hijra to count time forwards and backwards. The Hijra was the flight of the prophet  \nMohammed and his early followers from the town of Mecca to Medina in 622 AD. Hence, BH stands for the years before the Hijra, and AH refers to the years after the Hijra.\n1.\u2002Discuss in pairs and explain the difference between decade, century  \n    and millennium. \n2.\u2002Referring to a primary or secondary sources, write a paragraph about  \n    the arrival of Christianity and Islam in Ethiopia and present it to your  \n     class. \nHistorians sometimes use a timeline. A timeline is a graphic representation of events \nin chronological order or periods of history. It is a horizontal or a vertical lineup of  \nhistorical events. Historical timeline enables quick visualization  and forms a clear idea of the  \npassage of time about events. \uf03f"

Although hominids family no longer exists, we know that their representatives lived in the past. We  know this from the   \ndiscovery   of   many   fossils  that  represent  them.   All   hominids  are characterised by what is known as bipedalism, i.e., walking on two feet with an upright position. \nThe earliest hominid to be found in Ethiopia was discovered at Aramis in the Middle \nAwash of the Afar Regional State. It is described by a team of Paleontologists led by Tim White, and it is dated to around 4.4 million years ago. This species was followed by  \nanother fossil called Australopithecus afarensis. Finally, in 1974, Donald Johanson found the  \noldest complete human skeleton in Ethiopia. He named his find \u2018Lucy\u2019 after a Beatles\u2019 song. \nThe three different species that belong to the genus Homo are:\n\u2022\tHomo habilis, \n\u2022\tHomo erectus and \n\u2022\tHomo sapiens. \nHomo habilis is a handy human being and is considered the oldest human being. Fossils of \nHomo habilis were found in the Omo valley in Ethiopia. The second stage in early human \ndevelopment occurred with the appearance of Homo erectus (\u201cupright human being\u201d), a \nspecies that emerged around 2 million years ago. Homo erectus made use of larger and \nmore varied tools. These hominids were the first to leave Africa and move into Europe and Asia. They could do so because they learned to use fire to keep warm in colder areas. Fossils of this species were found in the Omo Basin, Melka-Kunture, Konso\u2013Gardula, and Middle Awash in Ethiopia.

Fossils \nof this species were found in the Awash and Omo valleys and the areas near Dire Dawa. Therefore, Ethiopia is proved to be the land where these species were discovered.\nModern Human beings (Homo sapiens sapiens) appeared around 100,000 years ago. They \nare different in many ways from their ancestors. They have large brains, are bipedal and walk upright. They think and execute complicated ideas. They use language, develop culture, invent tools and use them effectively. They transmit knowledge from generation to generation. \nIt is noteworthy that the region of Ethiopia and the Horn has sites illustrating all the three \nsub-species of the Homo family that appeared in succession: Homo habilis, Homo erectus \nand Homo sapiens. These successive stages marked the progressive refinement in making \ntools and the mastery of the technology of making a fire that Homo erectus accomplished. "

These are the  \ncreationist and the evolutionist (scientific) theories. The creationist view advocates the \nnotion that man, including all living things, was created by GOD or a supernatural being.\nThe scientific theory explains that all living things, including humans, result from a \ngradual succession process and variation from earlier forms. This slow and natural  \nprocess is called evolution. Thus this theory is called evolutionist. This theory was  \nformulated by the English scientist Charles Darwin (1809-1882). Eventually, it was  \nwidely accepted by the scientific communities. \nTime and again, the hominids that have been found so far were found in Ethiopia.

A great revolution took place during this age. The Neolithic Age has brought about the so-called Neolithic Revolution or Agricultural revolution. The real change in the  \nNeolithic Revolution was the shift from the hunting of animals and gathering food to keeping animals and growing crops regularly, which we call systematic agriculture. \nThe Neolithic agricultural revolution had far-reaching consequences. The prerequisites \nfor Civilization  were laid during this age. Agriculture was introduced and transformed the lives of Neolithic people. As a result, human beings began to produce food. This was followed by a sedentary way of life and a complex social organisation. Stone houses were built. Religious places and granaries were constructed. New and better tools like the hoe, the yoke, and the wheel appeared, and the use of animals in farming helped human  \nbeings produce more food. The change had such dramatic effects that historians call it the  \nNeolithic Agricultural revolution. In short, the Neolithic Revolution made human beings food producers and community dwellers. \nThe Neolithic revolution occurred at different times in various places. The earliest  \nevidence of the Neolithic comes from the Middle East some 11,000 years ago. The  \nmajor archaeological sites are found in Palestine, Mesopotamia, the Nile valley in Egypt,  \nTropical Africa, the Yangtze Kiang valley in China, the Indus valley in India, and parts of \nthe Americas.

For a state to exist, \nit must have the following features: population, territory, government, sovereignty and recognition.\nRegarding the emergence of states, scholars put forward different theories. One of \nthese theories is related to religion. As religion developed, priests appeared in early  \nsocieties. They began to play central roles in administrative spheres of society. Such  \nearly states were known as theocratic states. They were ruled by priests. Others say that  \nagriculture was the major reason for the emergence of the state.  As early society was divided  \neconomically into higher and lower classes, those who produced surplus became elites. Elites are rich people who had attained higher status in society due to their wealth. As a result, they would have control over others, thus leading to the emergence of the state. \nOthers insist that control over trade and trade routes were the principal reason for the \nemergence of the state. As a result, village chiefs who controlled the trade gradually  \nreplaced priests with the emergence of markets. In addition, these chiefs had the power of collecting tributes and keeping the security of villages and the needs around them. This development marked the appearance of states.

The silt from the Nile  \nreplenished the fertility of the soil and allowed the production of large amounts of crops. The Egyptian peasantry produced wheat and barley. Livestock also formed an integral part of the economy. Trade was another important economic activity in the empire. \nThe Egyptian empire was a large state ruled by an absolute king called a pharaoh. The king \nruled Egypt through officials named Viziers. The Viziers acted as mayors, tax collectors and judges. The pharaohs were regarded as kings and gods. He was believed to be an incarnated god and would indeed be a god after death, watching over Egypt\u2019s welfare. The Egyptians were polytheists. They worshipped many gods.

Greeks' culture developed chiefly in small city-states called Polis. A city-\nstate consists of a city or town and the surrounding villages and farmland. The best-known  \ncity-states were Athens and Sparta. The city-states never became united into a nation. However, they all had a common language, religion and culture. The Greeks called  \nthemselves Hellens and their land Hellas.\nGreek cultural achievements were outstanding in the classical period and were the ancient \nlegacy to Europe and the world.

These are Cushitic, Semitic and Omotic. A.  Cushitic: The vast majority speaks Cushitic language family in terms of both areal coverage and size of speakers. There is spillover into neighbouring countries. The Cushitic languages have sub-divisions: North Cushitic, Central Cushitic and Eastern Cushitic. \nChart 3.1  Afro-Asiatic Language families spoken in Ethiopia and the Horn \nIn ancient times, Northern Cushitic was widely spread between the Red Sea and the Nile Valley. North Cushitic is represented only by the Beja people's language, spoken in what is today Northwestern Eritrea. Central Cushitic spread during ancient times and is  \nrepresented by the Bilen in Eritrea and the Agaw languages (Qimant, Himitagna and  \nAwign) in Ethiopia. \nEastern Cushitic is both the largest and the most diverse branch of the Cushitic  \nfamily languages in Ethiopia. For this reason, it has been subdivided into Highland and  \nLowland East Cushitic. People under Lowland Cushitic, for instance include: Oromo, Afar,  \nSomali, Konso, Gidole, Erbore, Dassenech and Saho. They are called so because most \nof the speakers originally lived in the eastern lowlands of Ethiopia and the Horn.

Since  \nancient times, they have been native to the region and followed by the local people.  \nSedentary settlement and agricultural development saw the emergence of priests who conduct praying for rainfall, thanksgiving and safety from natural hazards. Farmers paid tributes for the services of priests. They laid the foundation for indigenous religions. They either worship or provide sacrifices to them. People of Indigenous Religion also owe special reverence to their ancestors. Followers of traditional religions believe that their supreme deity is the creator.\nA distinctive mark of indigenous religion is belief in one Supreme Being, but special \npowers are attributed to natural phenomena considered sacred. Spiritual functionaries  \nofficiate over rituals, propitiate divinities, and are held in a lot of respect as  \nintermediaries between society and spirits. For example, the Waqeffanna of the Oromo is based on the existence of one Supreme Being called Waqa. Waqa's power is manifested    through the spirits called Ayyana.  Revered experts, Qallu (male) and Qallitti  (female), \nhave maintained a link between the Ayyana and the believers. An exciting feature of  \nindigenous religion is its practices and beliefs are fused with Christianity and Islam. This  \nphenomenon of mixing of religions is known as syncretism.  \n1.\u2002Name the major Indigenous religions in your locality and tell your  \n     classmates how they are practiced. \n\uf03fBrainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat are the major religions of Ethiopia?\nEthiopia also has religious complexity, forming a competing platform for religious beliefs and practices. The major religions practised by diverse people of Ethiopia are indigenous religions, Judaism, Christianity and Islam."

Judaism \nJudaism has been practiced in Ethiopia from ancient times, according to sources. A group of people known by the name Bete-Israel literally, \"house of Israel\" and who descend from the Israelite tribes who came to Ethiopia during the Exodus from Israel practice it. The Bete-Isarel people formerly resided in northwest Ethiopia until their large flight back to Israel in the 1980s and 1990s. The Bete-Israel managed to maintain their Jewish  \ntradition for many generations despite constant pressure from their Christian neighbors.\nThe Judaism and Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church both adhere to the teachings of \nthe Old Testament section of the Bible. Both employ Geez for the liturgy and adhere to Old  \nTestament customs. Similar in appearance, symbolism, behavior, and hierarchy were their priests. They were hence more akin. The Bete Israel, however, clung persistently to  \nJudaic rituals and doctrines. Northern Ethiopia was mostly where the faith existed. There are currently only a few Jews left in Ethiopia.\n3. Christianity\nChristianity was introduced to Ethiopia around 330 AD by Frumentius (also known as Freminatos), who converted king Ezana (r.320-350 AD) and his close associates.  \nConsequently, Christianity secured royal support and became the state religion that later helped its expansion. With the coming of monks called the \u2018Nine Saints\u2019 towards the end of the fifth century, Christianity spread more among the broad masses. Churches were built, and monasteries were established, of which the first being the monastery of  \nDebre-Damo. The Bible was translated into Ge\u2019ez, and since then, Ge\u2019ez began to serve as the language of the Church in Ethiopia.\nFigure 3.1  Aksum Tsion Mariam, (source: UNESCO site)"

This tradition of  \nconsecrating and sending a bishop to Ethiopia continued until 1959 when Abune Baselios \nbecame the first Ethiopian Patriarch. Until that year, the head of the Church was always from Egyptian. \nThe expansion of Christianity continued during the Zagwe period (1150-1270) and  \nchiefly gained fresh momentum during the Early Medieval Period (1270-1527) when \nmany churches and monasteries were constructed across the territories that were newly incorporated into the Christian highland kingdom.

From the mid-sixteenth to the early  \nseventeenth centuries, the Catholics, namely the Jesuits, unsuccessfully tried to  \nconvert Ethiopian Orthodox Christians to Catholicism. In the mid-16th century, Ethiopian  \nrulers allowed Jesuits to preach in the country. In 1622, Susneyos publicly announced his  \nadherence to Catholicism, a strategy to reinforce his political power. \nThe Portuguese Jesuit Afonso Mendes was appointed Patriarch of Ethiopia in 1622 \nby Pope Urban VII and imposed changes against the former Orthodox religious  \npractices. These actions led to uprisings, social unrest and civil war in Gondar.  As a result,  \nSusneyos was forced to resign. His son, Emperor Fasilidas, expelled the Patriarch and the European missionaries in 1636. This action led to the complete closure of Ethiopia to further contact with Europeans until the early 19\nth century.\nAt the opening of the 19th century, Catholic and Protestant missionaries started  \nevangelisation activities in Ethiopia. The Catholic missionaries led by Giuseppe Sapeto, Giustino De Jacobis, and Cardinal Massaja, were active. Systematic approach by trained Protestants enabled them to win the confidence of local people. Protestant missions included the Anglican Church Missionary Society, the Church Missionary Society of London and the Wesleyan Methodist Society led by Samuel Gobat, C.W. Isenberg and J. L. Krapf. In the early 20\nth century, the Sudan Interior Mission started its work in Wolaita, Hadiya and Kambata. \nHowever, the missionaries were forced to leave the regions due to the Italian occupation. They returned after Italians were expelled from Ethiopia and Protestantism expanded further.\nBoth Catholic and protestant missionaries made use of various means to spread Christianity. \nFor example, they translated spiritual books into first languages; they adopted local names for God; they established schools and medical centers for the locals and preached the faith. Eventually, continuous and systematic indoctrinations seem to have resulted in the grafting of new teaching on indigenous religion. As a result, large numbers of followers were attracted.\n4. Islam\nIslam arose in the early 7\nth century in the Arabian Peninsula and spread to other parts \nof the world. When Prophet Mohammed began teaching Islam in Mecca, he came into a series of conflicts with the Quraysh tribe. When the persecution against his followers became serious, the Prophet sent a small group of his followers, including his daughter, to the kingdom of Aksum in 615 AD. Jafar Abu Talib led this first group of refugees. In his advice to his followers, the Prophet said of Ethiopia, \u201c\u2026a king under whom none are persecuted.

Protestantism was introduced to Ethiopia \nmainly in the early 19th century but widely spread in the 20th century through \nmissionary activities. \nIslam was founded by Prophet Mohammed around 610 AD. When the Quraysh \ntribe planned to attack, many Muslim refugees arrived in Ethiopia. Islam  \npenetrated the interior of Ethiopia through the port of Zeila, along which  \nMuslim sultanates were formed, Sultanate of Shewa being the earliest.  \nEthiopia's peopling and ethnocultural groups' formation resulted from a  \nlong-drawn-out process of fission and fusion. \nIn the past, it used to be widely believed that Aksum was the first centralised \npolity in Ethiopia and the Horn. However, there are many indications that  \nseveral principalities had emerged and declined before the emergence of  \nAksum. Punt, Hawlti-Melazo, Addi-Seglemeni, Metera, Kaskase and Damat are to mention few. \nThe Aksumite state derived much of its income from agriculture.

It \nwas called the Dark Ages because Civilization  declined in Western Europe during this  \nperiod. The Western Roman Empire was destroyed both by internal and external problems.  \nInternally the empire suffered division and decay. Externally it was invaded, in the 5th \nCentury AD, by the Anglo Saxons and Franks from the Germanic tribes, the Huns and the Magyars from the Asiatic tribes. \nThe invasions brought many changes in Western Europe. The Greco-Roman  \nCivilization  declined. The societies became rural, and cities declined. Feudalism became \nthe socio-economic and political order. Churches, castles and palaces were built. Bishops and monks kept records; The Knights practiced chivalry.  In addition, there was much war among rulers and lords in Europe, and even for ordinary people, there were murders and blood feuds. Nevertheless, by c. 1000 AD, more stability was returning. Feudal society emerged from the Dark Ages.\n4.1.2 Feudal Society\nAs Western Europe fell apart, the number of separate powerful lords and vassals  \nincreased. Thus, from 500 to 1500, a new socio-political system called feudalism emerged. The ruling class was made up of kings, nobles, knights (soldiers) and the higher clergy. The vassalage system relates a higher lord to a lower lord in feudalism. In this system, the higher lord gave fief to the lower lord. Then, the lower lord became a vassal of the higher one. Fief or feud is a piece of land. Thus, feudalism was a system of holding land and providing service in exchange.

The capital of the Byzantine Empire was Constantinople (modern Istanbul). The official language of the Empire became Greek. The Orthodox Church was officially separated from the Roman Catholic Church in 1054. It became the national church of the Empire and supported the emperor. \nThe economic base of the Empire was agriculture, trade and crafts. Byzantine  \narchitecture made use of domes and beautifully colored glasses. The society was divided \ninto social hierarchy: the emperor, the higher clergy, the nobility who owned land and the peasants who cultivated it. The Byzantine Empire was at the height of its territory and \npower under Emperor Justinian (r. 527-565).   \nMap 4.1  Byzantine Empire, (source: Encyclopedia, Britannica)\nThe Seljuk Turks who began military occupation in Asia Minor in 1040 AD challenged the Byzantine Empire. This event was followed by the crusades that began in the 1090s. The crusades waged wars of Christian Europe against Seljuk Turks to liberate Christian holy lands. There were eight major Crusades, the first of which was started in 1096. The crusades failed to crush Muslim power in the holy lands but protected Western Europe from foreign invasions in the east. The Byzantine Empire suffered a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071. It lost most Asia Minor to Seljuk Turkish rulers and later to Ottoman Turks. "

Following the death of the Prophet, Muslims came under the Arab Caliphates of the Umayyad and Abbasid dynasties in the Middle Ages. The death of the Prophet was followed by the great Arab conquests establishing a Muslim Arab empire from North Africa and Spain in the west to Central Asia in the east. \nThe Seljuk and Ottoman Turk\u2019s military occupation in Palestine, Asia Minor, and Arabia \ncontributed to Islam's expansion.

Discuss in groups the importance of early capitalist relation.\n4.4 The Age of Explorations and Discoveries \nThe age of European explorations and discoveries was in the fifteenth and sixteenth  \ncenturies. The explorations were, in part, initiated by the need to bypass the Ottoman Turkish blockade of the old long-distance trade route from Europe to the Far East.Factors that encouraged explorations and discoveries were: \n\u2022\tEuropean interest in long-distance trade and new inventions like the compass. \n\u2022\tIn addition, the development of better maps and ships and the growing interest in geographical knowledge fueled the idea of exploration. \n\u2022\tPrince Henry, the Navigator (1394-1460) of Portugal and Queen Isabella (1451-1504) of Spain, who supported the voyages of explorers, also inspired the  \nexploration. They sponsored voyages for the sake of their economy,  \nreligion and glory. Spain and Portugal were the leaders in the exploration and  \ndiscoveries in the 15\nth and 16th centuries. They were closely followed by  \nHolland, Britain, France and Russia. \nPortuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a new sea route to India and the Far East in 1498.

They established various Protestant Churches. For instance: French  \nprotestant Jean Calvin, who lived in Switzerland, established a Calvinist protestant church \nin Switzerland. The Calvinist followers in French were called Huguenots. The Scottish John Knox found his type of Calvinist Protestantism called Presbyterian in 1560. King Henry VIII and Queen Elizabeth I separated the English Protestant Church from the  \nRoman Catholic Church in England. Nevertheless, the English Protestants managed to establish a national church which came to be called Anglican Church. \nProtestantism enforced the Catholic Church into Counter-Reformation. The Catholic \nChurch carried out the (Catholic) Counter-Reformation to reform itself in response to the Protestant challenge of the time. A missionary organisation called the Society of Jesus was formed in Spain by Ignatius Loyola in 1534 to reform Catholics in America, Asia and Africa. The members of the society were called Jesuits, were active in the Americas.  \nAnti-Catholics were attacked and even were killed. The peasants\u2019 wars of Germany against Catholics were fought between 1524 and 1525. Reformation played an essential role in the Thirty Years\u2019 War (1618-1648).

Machine now did work done previously by hand with simple tools and equipment. Europe saw a shift from an economy based on farming and handicrafts to an economy based on manufacturing by machine in factories. It began in Great Britain in the 1780s and took several decades to spread to other Western nations. \nThe machine of the Industrial Revolution was operated by a new form of power known \nas steam power, replacing the early wind and water power. Savry (1698) and Newcomer (c.1705-1711). James Watt (1782-84) improved the steam engines and adopted them for operating all kinds of machinery, including machine in factories. Then the steam power was applied to transport, the first steamboat on the rivers and then steamships at sea.  \nFinally, steam power was used to land transport in the form of railways. The first railways locomotive was built in 1804. \nBy the mid-nineteenth century, Great Britain had become the world\u2019s first and richest  \nindustrial nation.

The Mamluks were of Turkish origin. They gradually became military commanders and took power militarily. They founded their  \ndynasty that ruled Egypt from 1250 to 1517. After that, they expanded into Palestine, Syria, Europe and Asia. Besides, Egypt, under the Mamluk, witnessed critical economic  \ndevelopments. During the rule of the Mamluks, Ethio-Egyptian relations was full of conflicts. \nHowever, the Ethiopian ruler, Zera Yacob (r. 1434 - 1468), tried to create smooth relations. \nBut their relation short-lived. The Mamluk power started to decline because of corruption, the decline in agricultural productivity, cattle plague and drought. Firearms helped the Ottoman Turks to defeat the Mamluk force in Palestine, and they occupied Egypt in 1517.\nB) The Funj Sultanate \nThe Funj sultanate was established in 1504 by cattle keeping nomads in  \nnortheast Africa- in the present-day Republic of Sudan. The Funj established their  \nSultanate in 1504 with its capital at Sennar. Like Mamluks, the Funj sultanate fought against the Christian kingdom of Ethiopia due to rivalry over trade routes.

Ghana relied on Trans - the Saharan trade, and its rulers were able to build a vast empire. However, the rise of Islam was the main factor for the greatness and decline of Ghana.

The Mali Empire had many profound cultural influences on West  \nAfrica that allowed the spread of its language, laws and customs along the Niger  \nRiver. The greatest king of Mali was Mansa Musa (1312-1337), who made a pilgrimage to  \nMecca. During his time, Islam expanded in the Empire vastly. \nFigure 5.1  Cartoon of Mansa Musa  (source: historyhustle.com)\nMali was famous for its Islamic studies. Timbuktu, the capital of Mali, became one of the most important Islamic learning and culture centers.\nAfter Mansa Musa, there was no king as powerful as he was. The great kingdom of Mali \nweakened due to inefficient leadership and attacks from the neighbouring peoples, such as Tuareg. Although Mali fell, another advanced African kingdom took its place, the  \nKingdom of Songhai.C) SonghaiThe Songhai people established the Empire named after their name, with its capital at Gao. The Songhai people had been subject to Ghana and then to Mali at various times. However, towards the end of the 14\nth century, they threw off the over-lordship of Mali. \nThe Empire extended from the central area of today's Nigeria to the Atlantic coast.  "

The people were \nboth pastoralists and farmers. These city-states were Kano, Katsina, Zazzau (Zaria), Gobir, Kebbi, Rano and Zamfara.

Some became extremely wealthy as a result of trade.  \nBeginning in the 1st millennium BC, new peoples migrated into eastern Africa from the \nwest. Farming peoples who spoke dialects of the Bantu family began to move from the region of the Niger River into East Africa and the Congo River basin. They moved slowly, not as invading hordes but as small communities.\nA) Kongo \nThe Kingdom of Kongo was located on the lower bank of the Zaire River. Bantu people founded it in the late 14\nth century. The people were hunters and warriors. They were also \nclever smiths. Apart from agriculture, trade played an important role in the kingdom's economy. The explorers reached the Kongo in 1482 and 1491. Missionaries who were converted to Catholicism arrived having such footsteps. The Portuguese colonised the kingdom.\nB) Swahili city-states \nAbout 2000 years ago, Bantu speaking people established small village settlements along the coast of the Indian ocean. After the rise of Islam, the region received a great  \nimpetus from Muslim Arabic speaking merchants who married into local ruling families.  \nSubsequently, the language and culture were developed distinctly African but with  \nIslamic and Arabic influences. These mixed Bantu-Arab stocks their language called  \nSwahili, meaning \"coasters\" in Arabic. Swahili is now a common language in East African  \ncountries.\nThe Swahili Civilization  is an example of cultural diffusion formed from the  \ninteraction between Arabic, Persian and Bantu traditions. There were several important \ncoastal commercial centers called Swahili city-states. Among the most important and  \ninfluential coastal cities or ports were Mogadishu (in Somalia), Malindi and Mombasa (in Kenya), Zanzibar and Kilwa (in Tanzania), Brava Pate, Pemba and Sofala. The most  \nfamous and imposing was Kilwa, situated on a small island. Kilwa became the main center of the East African gold and ivory trade. \nWealthy Muslim elites ruled the Swahili cities. Evidence suggests that their  \ncommercial relations with Arabia, the Persians, Indian and Chinese existed long before the  \nPortuguese arrival in the area. From the very beginning, the Portuguese aimed to destroy \nthe growing power of Muslims in East Africa. Impressed by east Africa's gold and ivory trade, the Portuguese established a trading fort at Sofala in 1505. "

However, these independent villages gradually consolidated in some parts of  \nsouthern Africa, starting in the eleventh century. Out of these groupings came the first states. \nA) Zimbabwe \nThe founders of Great Zimbabwe were the Bantu speaking people of Shona who began their rule about AD 1000. They built Great Zimbabwe. In the thirteenth or fourteenth century, stone houses and walls were built in Great Zimbabwe. Great Zimbabwe was a medieval African city known for its large circular wall and tower.

However, later on, the Portuguese conquered Mwene  \nMutapa in the late sixteenth century.\nB) The Khoi-Khoi \nInitially, the Khoi-Khoi people were hunters. Since 1000 AD, however, they made a change from the hunting way of life to that of sheep and cattle breeding.  \nBeginning from 1300  AD, the Khoi-Khoi expanded from present-day Botswana.

Europeans called them Bushmen. The San lived by hunting and gathering. Men hunted animals with bows and poison-tipped arrows.

Two important trade routes connected west and west-central Africa with north-central and north-west Africa. They linked the major ancient and medieval states of West Africa. The other route crossed the central Sahara and connected North Africa with the kingdom of  \nKanem. A sub-branch linked West Africa and Egypt. The trade routes across the desert also  \nconnected Africa with the outside world. \nMap 5.3  Trans-Saharan trade routes, (Source: Kievin Shillington, 1995)Lesson learning outcomes\nAt the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:\n\u2022\tevaluate the impacts of the slave trade on Africa.\n\u2022\tindicate routes of the Trans Saharan trade by sketching a map.\n\u2022\tevaluate the impact of the slave trade on Africa\u2019s development.\nBrainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat do you know about the Sahara Desert and the trade route that passes through it?\n"

In addition, enslaved  \npeople became important trade goods after the emergence of the Arabs in the 7th century \nAD. \nThe Trans-Saharan trade contributed to developing robust economic and political  \nsystems on both sides of the Sahara.

In addition, the trade facilitated the spread of Islam and Islamization in West and West-Central Africa.\n1.\u2002Show trade routes of the Trans Saharan by sketching a map.\n5.9 Early Contacts with the Outside World\nDue to the accessibility of the East African coast, there was wide spread interaction  \nbetween it and the people from the outside world. The early contacts were mainly with Arabs, Greeks, Persians, Romans, Chinese, Indians, Spain and Portuguese. \nWhat is Europe's perception of Africa? Europeans created an image of Africa that was the \nperverse opposite of Europe's. By comparison with and in contrast to this image, Europe's general superiority would be self-evident. Europe's idea of itself was thus predicated on its image of Africa.\nSince the mid-fifteenth century, the turn of global events brought Africa closer to the rest \nof the world. Europeans, especially Portugal and Spain, were determined to dominate international trade. To this end, both countries sponsored navigators. The exploration and subsequent contact with European powers enormously contributed to the ever-changing African economy, culture, language, politics, and environment. \n Brainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat do you know about Arabs, Spain and Portuguese and \ntheir relations with Africa?\uf03f"

Arabic, \nEnglish, French, Spanish, and Portuguese are a few. \nBefore 1500 AD, several historical developments took place in different parts \nof Africa. Consequently, some big Islamic empires were established in the  \nnorthern African region.\nIn North Africa, Egypt became great under the Turkish origin Mamluk rule, \nwho founded their dynasty that ruled Egypt from 1250 to 1517. However, the Funj state was a loosely united sultanate and continued to exist until Egypt  \nconquered it in the 1820s. During Mamluks, Ethio- Egyptian relations was full of  \nconflicts.  Like Mamluks, the Fuji sultanate fought against the Christian king -\ndom of Ethiopia due to rivalry over trade routes. \nAfter politico-religious rivalries in the 11\nth century, there was a revival of  \nIslam in North Africa. This was also followed by the expansion of the West  \nAfrican Empires. By controlling the Trans-Saharan trade, several small states \ngrew into powerful empires in western Africa: Ancient Ghana, Mali, Songhay, Hausa States and Kanem Bornu. In southern Africa, the Civilization  in great Zimbabwe was of a high standard.  After 1450 AD, the Rozwi clan kings of the Shona people established an empire called MweneMutapa.\nNevertheless, the Portuguese conquered Mwene Mutapa in the late sixteenth \ncentury. The Trans-Saharan trade contributed to developing robust economic and political systems on both sides of the Sahara. The spread of Islam in tropical Africa further strengthened the relationship with the peoples of North Africa. Africa has maintained relations with the outside world since ancient times.\n The most important link was trading.  Next, the introduction of Christianity \nand Islam to Africa shaped Africa\u2019s relations with the outside world. Europeans, especially Portugal and Spain, were determined to dominate Africa. Most of the kingdoms and empires of Africa came to an end in the sixteenth century, which was also when the Atlantic slave trade began. Unit Summary\uf026"

Portugal also had an objective to \ncreate commercial links with Africa. \nIn addition, the conquest of territory in Africa also meant that the Portuguese could use \nAfrican gold to finance travel along this new trade route. Getting safe passage through Africa could also open the entire Indian Ocean to direct Portuguese trade. \nCeuta- was the first step forward in Portuguese expansion across the Atlantic coast in \n1415. King Jo\u00e3o, I (John I) and his sons organised an expedition to conquer Ceuta that lay across the Straits of Gibraltar on the coast of North Africa, specifically in today\u2019s  \nMorocco. The Portuguese stayed in this part of Morocco from 1415 to 1769, a long period of constant war, since the Portuguese presence was not accepted.\nFinally, in 1432, the Portuguese reached Cape Bajador, further southwest of Ceuta in  \nMorocco, on the shores of the Atlantic Coast. Similarly, a Portuguese explorer named \nNuno Trisatao reached Cape Blanc, further south along the Atlantic coast, in 1441. \nSenegambia - Portuguese arrived on the shores of Sierra Leon in 1460 and stayed there \nuntil their gradual decline as leaders in world exploration in the 16\nth Century. In West  \nAfrica, Senegambia was one of the earliest regions affected by European trade.  \nSenegambia state also provided enslaved people for European purchase for roughly a \ncentury; perhaps a third of all enslaved Africans exported during the sixteenth Century came from Senegambia. \nGold Coast: In the course of exploration of the west coast of Africa, the Portuguese  \nencountered various African kingdoms. One of such kingdoms was Ghana (Gold Coast). \nSome controlled substantial deposits of gold in the soil, salt, enslaved people, and others. In 1482, the Portuguese built their first permanent trading post known as the Castle of Elmina on the western coast of present-day Ghana.\nThis fortress was constructed to protect Portuguese trade from European competitors, \nand hostile Africans still stand. However, the intensive contact of the Gold Coast with  \nEuropeans also led to the importation. In addition, it spread American crops, notably maise and cassava. \nThe success of these crops in West and Central Africa is believed to have  \ncontributed to population growth in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. During the  \nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, other European powers soon followed in its  \nfootsteps; adventurers such as Dutch, English, and the French joined the competition for "

It has a long history in Africa, Europe and Asia. In the fifteenth century, it continued at a fairly steady level. The primary market for enslaved Africans was Southwest Asia, where most enslaved people were used as domestic  \nservants. Captives from Nubia were transported down the Nile to Egypt in ancient Pharaonic times. Some were also transported across the Sahara to North Africa in  \nRoman times. In contrast, others were sent out of northeast Africa to labour in the  \nPersian Gulf and Indian states. All of these numbers seem small when compared with the  \nTrans-Atlantic Slave Trade.Lesson learning outcomes\nAt the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:\n\u2022\texplain the factors that led to the development and decline of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade.\n\u2022\tdescribe the economic activities of Africans during the Trans-Atlantic and slave trade period.\n\u2022\texplain how the slave trade affected the African economy. \n\u2022\tanalyse the living conditions of African people during the Trans-Atlantic and the Trans-Saharan slave trade.\n\u2022\tsketch a map to indicate the Trans-Atlantic and the Trans-Saharan trade routes.\n\u2022\texplain  the political and economic influences of other continents on Africa during the period.\n\u2022\tcrciticise the crime against humanity committed during the slave trade.\nBrainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat is slavery and slave trade?\uf03f"

For example, in the ancient Civilization s of Europe, Asia and  \nAfrica, persons defined as slaves were distinct social groups whose lives were routinely \ncontrolled by others. The expansion of long-distance trade and many of the early kings of Mali and Songhai and other states promoted the use of slave labour in agriculture. \nIn Benin's West-African state, for example, large numbers of slaves were used in  \nagriculture.

The raw materials produced on American  \nplantations were exported to Europe, where they were manufactured as finished products for sale. Such goods as cotton, alcoholic drinks, firearms and metal wares were taken from Western Europe to Africa. These goods were exchanged for slaves. So, the whole process formed the triangular shape. \nThen, the enslaved Africans were taken across the Atlantic to the Americas.

The first phase was known \nas the Piratic slave trade. It began in the fifteenth century and continued up to the 1580s. In this phase, the traders were individual merchants, adventurers, navigators or common sea robbers. The second phase was known as the monopolistic slave trade. It began in the 1580s.

It also discouraged political \ndevelopment and encouraged violence. Constant wars, in turn, destroyed African states. Socially, the slave trade undermined the morality and dignity of Africans. The Triangular trade caused great human suffering and horrors on Africans. Enslaved people were never treated as human beings but as properties. The Triangular trade also depopulated Africa of its productive young men and women. It also had tragic effects on the lives of individual victims and their families.

In 1657, Van  \nRiebeck, the company commander, released some of the soldiers from their contracts and \nallowed them to set up their own business as Boers (farmers). The Boers were provided with enslaved West Africans. The Boers\u2019 settlement on Khoisan grazing land directly led to the first Khoi-Dutch war in 1659. In this violent armed conflict, the Khoisan managed to unite and drove the Boers back to their former position at the coast. In the Second  \nKhoi-Dutch war of 1673-77, the natives could not win over the Dutch.\nThe Khoisan also withdrew into the interior, beyond the boundaries of the Boers  \ncolony. Several groups of Khoisan were able to achieve some degree of independence by  \nmoving extreme north and south of the Orange River. Losing their economic and political \nindependence to the Boers, the Khoisan agreed to collaborate and work for the Boers as herdsmen and hunters. They, therefore, retained some access to land. Orphaned Khoisan children were an additional source of labour for the Boers.\nAs a result of the Dutch success, the Khoisan lost their material resources, political rights, \nlanguage, and other aspects of their cultural identity. As a result, they began to adopt the Dutch language and culture. They even served as Boer commanders against their people and the Xhosa in some cases.\nThrough contacts and minor conflicts in the first decade of the 18\nth century, the actual  \nviolence between the Xhosa and the trek Boers began as the settlers moved into the fertile \ngrazing land of Zuurveld in the 1770s. The Xhosa had more population than the Khoisan and a closely-knit social organisation. They were, therefore, a formidable opposition to the colonists.   The violent conflicts between the Trek Boers and the Xhosa began in 1779 and continued for a century. It is estimated that nine frontier wars took place during this time. Nevertheless, coming from a strong warrior tradition, the Xhosa held onto most of Zuurveld until the early 19\nth century.\nIn 1795, the British government seized the Cape Colony from the Dutch settlers for  \nstrategic purposes. While the Dutch occupied the Cape with establishing a fresh station for their crew members, the British occupied it to prevent its falling to the hands of the French. "

The strength of the white settlers in the newly conquered area of the Xhosa grew in 1829 with the settlement of 500 British immigrants. In the sixth war (1834-35), the British pushed the Xhosa west of the Kei River. However, to the disgust of the Boers, the British handed back the territory between Keiskama and Kei Rivers to the Xhosa and abolished slavery in its cape colony. The Boers, who used slave labour, were irritated by the British policy, which favoured the natives. \nThe Boers left the cape area in 1835 and moved to the north in what is known as the Great \ntrek for the following reasons:  \n\u2022\tas a reaction to the law that gave native Africans and the coloured freedom \n\u2022\tas a sign of opposition to the new ideas of equality between blacks and whites. \nIn the late 1830s, several thousand Boer families and their servants trekked northwards from the Eastern Cape."

Between the 1780s and 1870s, many European explorers travelled to the heart of Africa in an attempt to rectify their ignorance of the continent. \nEuropean explorers to Africa, before the 1850s, were usually portrayed by historians as \nmotivated by a spirit of pure, unbiased and scientific enquiry. Many of them might have seen themselves in that light. Others were attracted by the sense of adventure, desire for fame or both. However, the motive of those who financed the journeys praised their  \ndiscoveries and devotedly read their books were the chance of more significant trading profit in the future. Of course, much of Africa remained to be mapped, but European  \nexplorers were generally direct agents of colonial expansion.\nRoman Catholic Christian missionaries from Portugal closely followed the early  \nPortuguese coastal penetration of tropical Africa. In the late 15\nth and early 16th  \ncenturies, Catholic missionaries were sent to Africa to convert several African rulers. These  \nrulers, it was hoped, would become valuable allies of the Portuguese.

Portuguese missionaries were expelled or even \nkilled in one African state after another. This was mainly because they and their handful of converts offered a direct challenge to the established political and religious order . \nAfrican rulers were interested in contact with Europeans, but they wanted new trading openings, technical assistance and firearms. They did not want fresh ideas that threatened the traditional religious basis of their authority. As a result, Portuguese missionaries made little headway in Benin. Their attempt to convert the Oba (ruler of Edo People of Benin) was abandoned in the early 16th century. Greater success was achieved in Kongo, where a Christian convert became king in 1506. \nIn Ethiopia, missionaries of the newly founded Jesuit order followed hot on the heels of \nPortuguese military assistance to Galadewos in the early 1540s. However, they had little success in converting Ethiopian Orthodox Christian to the Roman Catholic version of the faith. Then, in the mid-17\nth century, they were expelled for political interference. \nLooking back from the 18th century, it was clear that European Christianity, as a vehicle \nfor religious and cultural change, had virtually no impact on the peoples of Sub-Saharan Africa. Nevertheless, during the 19\nth century, many European Christian societies sent their \nmissionaries to Africa. Among them, the most important were the British based Anglican Church Missionary Society. It was prominent in Sierra Leone; the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society and the London Missionary Society. It had bases and schools along the West African coastal region; the London Missionary Society initially worked mainly in South Africa. Protestant missions also came from France, Germany, Holland and the United States.

When the Portuguese first sailed out on their voyages of exploration along the West African coast, reaching India was their distant objective. \nTheir immediate goal was to bypass Muslim North Africa and gain direct  \naccess to the gold producing region of West Africa. The Trans-Atlantic slave trade  \nbegan within three important circumstances in West Africa. The first was the fragmentation of large, indigenous political states,  \nparticularly those with large armies such as Ghana, Mali and Songhai. The  \nsecond was the region's growing importance as a source of enslaved people for \nthe caravan traffic across the Sahara into the Mediterranean and Levant. The third was the conflict between the small coastal states in the region and their  \nwillingness to cooperate with European traders in exchanging slaves for arms. \nFinally, however, Europeans gradually outlawed the slave trade; they found \nWest Africa the fertile field for \"legitimate commerce\".  In 1652, the Dutch trading company established a tiny permanent settlement on the southern shores of South Africa. \nThe purpose was to regulate the trade with the Khoisan and have fresh fruit \nand vegetables for their ships.

Yekuno  \nAmlak claimed to be the descendant of the Aksumite kings. Accordingly, he founded the \nso-called \"Solomonic\" dynasty, using the legend of Queen of Sheba and King Solomon. This dynasty, which came to power in 1270, called itself \"Solomonic\". Yekuno Amlak and his followers took this dynastic name to justify their legitimacy by claiming that the Zagwe rulers were illegitimate.\nSimilarly, the name \"Solomonic\" is placed in quotation marks because the claim of descent \nfrom King Solomon of Israel is legendary and cannot be historically proven. However, the claim was elaborated in the Kibre Negest (\"Glory of Kings\") in the 14\nth century. The Kibre \nNegest claims that the Ethiopian ruling class descended from the line of Menilek I, son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon of Israel. As a result, Ethiopian monarchs from Yikuno Amlak to Emperor Haile Silassie I claimed descent from Menilek I.\nIn 1270, when it came to power, the Christian Kingdom was confined to the territory of \nSouthern Eretria, Tigray, Lasta and the northern part of Shewa.

Its territorial limits covered the ancient highland provinces of Aksum and Zagwe in the north. It also covered the regions of Gondar and eastern Gojjam in the northwest, Bizamo and Damot in the southwest, the Gurage lands and the Omotic populations of Wolaita and Gamo in the south and Ifat, Fatagar, Dawaro, Hadiya and Bali in the east and southeast. Amde-Tsion was the first \"Solomonic\" King, who embarked on a wider and rapid territorial expansion policy.\nTheir main motives of expansion were economic and political, i.e., to control the trade \nroutes and territorial seizures. The control over the Zeila trade route helped Yekuno  \nAmlak strengthen his economic power. In turn, the economic strength helped him to  \norganize and sustain a strong army. As a result, the Christian Kingdom controlled  \nextensive territories during the reign of Emperor Amde-Tsion. The period also  \nwitnessed the expansion of trade, leading to the flow of commodities to the coast. This  \neconomic and military strength contributed much to his success in defeating his  \nopponents and expanding his kingdom.\nAfter Yikuno-Amlak's reign ended in 1285, political instability caused constant power \nstruggles among his sons and grandsons for succession. The succession issue appears to have been partially resolved in 1300, during the reign of Widim-Ra'ad (r. 1299-1314), with the establishment of a 'royal prison' at Amba-Gishen in present-day southern  \nWollo. The royal family's male members were all imprisoned at the Amba Gishen,  \naccording to the rule. The royal prison was guarded by loyal soldiers to the reigning  \nmonarch. When the monarch died, court dignitaries would dispatch an army to the royal prison to accompany the designated heir to the throne. This practice continued until Imam \nAhmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's force destroyed Amba-Gishen in 1540.\nThe medieval monarchs had no permanent capital like Aksum or Lalibela from 1270 \nuntil the establishment of Gondar in 1636. Instead, for two centuries, they ruled over a vast territory through mobile courts. Initially, the \"restored\" dynasty was centered around Lake Haiq in today's South Wollo. However, it gradually shifted southward to the  \ndistricts of Menz, Tegulet, and Bulga in northern Shewa, and finally to the eastern Shewa  \nregions dominated by the great heights of the Yerer and Zequalla. The use of mobile camps was necessitated by the need to obtain daily food supplies and firewood for such a large  \nnumber of court officials, soldiers, and servants.\nInitially, military motives prompted the Ethiopian ruling elite to change their capitals \nfrom fixed to mobile settlements. These mobile capitals were adapted in several ways:"

In other words, the very adaptations to the wandering capitals themselves had a feedback effect on the pattern of movement. They, therefore, contributed to a continuation of capital movement.\nThe physical environment of medieval cities was not pleasant. The cities were often \ndirty and smelled of animal and human waste. Air pollution was also a fact of life. Even worse, pollution came from the burning of firewood.  Cities were also unable to stop water  \npollution, especially from animal slaughtering. Such tradition of the medieval period brought about deforestation because trees were cut down for daily requirements of the camp dwellers. As a result, the camp sites and surroundings were abandoned.\n \n1.\u2002Explain why the Christian Kingdom used mobile capitals from 13th to  \n     16th centuries. Browse the internet or refer to other sources.\n2.\u2002Describe where the capital cities tend to be located during the medieval  \n      period and discuss why they appeared there.\nTo effectively administer over this vast territory, the Christian Kingdom consolidated \na feudal system of administration known as the gult system. Under this system, state  \nofficials were guaranteed the right to collect tribute from the local peasantry (called the gult right). Gult right was a right given to an official to share the produce of the peasantry. An official given this right by the state was known as bale-gult or gult owner . \nPeasants were given to him based on his rank in the state hierarchy. The bale-gult enjoyed several political and economic privileges over the peasants under him. He had the right to collect tributes in kind and use them to maintain himself and his family. He could also use the labour of peasants under him for different purposes. Moreover, he could recruit a local army and command them in wars during the period of local or national crises.\uf03f"

So, this system immensely helped simplify administering the vast  \nChristian empire by dividing it into smaller units. It also enabled the Christian kingdom to maintain a large territorial army, which the kingdom used to bring Muslims and other states under its control. \nA rist right is a claim to the hereditary ownership of land. Rist right was a communal  \nbirthright to land. The state provided them with security, whereas the peasants were \nobliged to pay tribute or gibber to the state. Gult right was given to a state official in return for his service to the state. So, it was a medieval substitute for salary. It lasted as long as the official remained loyal to the state. It was not hereditary. For an extended period, the gult system remained a predominant feature of Ethiopian feudalism.\nLike the Zagwe rulers, the kings of the new \u201cSolomonic\u201d dynasty maintained the  \npolitical and cultural traditions of Aksum. They continued to expand Christianity in  \ndifferent directions. The rulers exercised both political and religious powers at the same \ntime.

Therefore, they need to control the Zeila trade to become the primary \nsource of conflict between the two states. Frequent skirmishes between the two finally resulted in the defeat of Ifat by the Christian forces of Amde Seyon in 1332 AD. There were several other small Muslim Sultanates to the south, east and north of the Ifat. The Sultanates of Fatagar emerged around the middle of the 13\nth century. The Sultanate was \nsituated south of the present-day Bulga around Shenkora. \nDawaro was located between the middle Awash River and upper Wabe-Shebele.  \nFurther, Bali\u2019s location was in the rich area south of the Wabe-Shebele. We do not know \nwhen Bali emerged as a state. Dara probably existed between Dawaro and Bali states. Whereas, Arbabini was located between Dawaro and Hadiya, about which we know very  \nlittle. Hadiya was located to the west of the Dawaro and Bali. We do not know when the  \nSultanate comes to power. However, the Sultanate was mentioned for the first time during the reign of Amde Seyon.  Sharaka was located in the present territory of Arsi.\nSimilarly, there is no tangible evidence of when the Sultanate emerged as a state.  \nHowever, from the 14\nth century onwards, it existed as a tributary to the Christian  \nkingdom until the first quarter of the 16th century.  Trade was one of the significant factors that  \nresulted in the rise and development of those states. Trade served as a significant source \nof livelihood. It acted as a major agent that resulted in the formation of Muslim sultanates. However,  it remained a major source of conflict between the Christian Kingdoms and Muslim  \nsultanates. After its establishment, Ifat conducted a series of campaigns against its  \nneighbouring sultanates, extending its hegemony over these areas. It also resisted the  \nexpansion of the Christian Kingdom. \nOne branch of the Walasma family realized that Ifat was becoming an easy target to the \nChristian Kingdom due to its location. So, it moved further to the south-eastern lowlands and established a new and vigorous Muslim Sultanate of Adal in the highland districts around Harar in 1367. One of the strong Muslim sultanates that emerged along trade routes and became a centre of resistance against the Christian Kingdom until the second half of the sixteenth century was the Sultanate of Adal. The first centre of this extended Walasma Dynasty was at a place called Dakar, located in the southeast of Harar. The Walasma family consolidated its power in the new centre and began another phase of  \nmilitary campaigns against the frontiers of the Christian Kingdom. As a result, in 1520, the centre of Adal was changed to the city of Harar. The defeat of Imam Ahmed in 1543 \nand the Oromo population movement and expansion forced the Sultanate to change its capital to Awsa in 1576/7, which is in the present Afar region."

It was a source of great \nwealth. It also served as a link among the peoples of Ethiopia. The desire for  \nterritorial expansion was also another source of rivalry among the peoples and states of the Ethiopian region. The revival of long-distance trade caused competition and struggle for control over the trade routes between the Christian kingdoms and the Muslim principalities. The height of the war came between 1529 and 1543.\nIn the beginning, the Zeila trade route was under the control of the Muslim states, \nmainly Ifat. However, in 1332 Ifat was defeated by the Christian kingdom and lost its  \nindependence. Thus monopoly over the route went to Amde Seyon. To regain their  \nindependence and control over the Zeila trade route Haqadin II and Sa'adadin retreated to the Harar plateau and set up a new Muslim resistance base in the late fourteenth century.Lesson learning outcomes\nAt the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:\n\u2022\tcriticise how conflicts between the Christian kingdom and Muslim sultanates are presented as if they were religious ones.\n\u2022\tanalyse the relationship between the Christian kingdom and the Muslim  \nSultanates as well as the other States.\n\u2022\tacknowledge the contributions of trade routes in linking the states and peoples \nin Ethiopia and the Horn.\nBrainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat do you know about the relationship between the  \nChristian kingdom and Muslim sultanates?  \uf03f"

Such leadership came from Imam Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi. The origin of Imam Ahmed, also named \nas \u201cthe left-handed\u201d is obscure. He was born at Hubet in between Dire Dawa and Jigjiga and raised by his devout Muslim kin in one of the oases on the route to Zeila. \nAfter Imam Ahmad came to power, battles were fought for control of the long-distance \ntrade routes through Zeila.  One of the Imam's notable achievements in his leadership \nwas that he mobilized the pastoral communities of Afar, Argoba, Somali, Harari and \nothers for a common cause. He persuaded them to cooperate instead of fighting among  \nthemselves. He consolidated his army to fight the Christian Kingdom. \nHis military expeditions against the Christian forces of Lebne Dengel started in 1527.  \nRecognizing the impending danger, Lebne-Dengel gathered a massive force in 1528. However, due to a logistical issue, the Christian Kingdom's army leadership was unable to defeat Adal's force. In March 1529 the Muslim force of Imam Ahmed achieved victory \nover the Christian army at the battle of Shimbra Kure, near the present town of Mojjo. The forces of the Imam then continued to score other brilliant victories over those of Lebne \nDengel. The Imam's army fought fiercely and controlled the territories including Bali, \nDawaro, Fatagar, Sidama, Hadiya and Kambata, and the Christian Kingdom was at risk. By 1535, Imam Ahmed's empire stretched from Zeila to Massawa on the coast, including the Ethiopian interior. As he penetrated deep into the Christian Kingdom, Imam Ahmed established a civil, administrative bureaucracy constituted by his men and newly recruited personnel from the Christian territories. \nOne of the most helpful figures during the war was the wife of the Imam, Bati Del  \nWanbara. She was the daughter of a Muslim military commander of Adal known as  \nMahfuz. She accompanied her husband throughout his expeditions. Conflict in the Ethiopian region began to take an international dimension when  \nPortugal and Ottoman Turkey intervened for their advantage. Since the twelfth century, \nEuropeans had found the long-distance trade route from Europe to the Far East blocked by the Ottoman Turks. Ottoman Turkey was an established power in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Indian Ocean regions. The Portuguese were also interested in getting new ones on the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea coasts."

Imam Ahmed had received Turkish musketeers in 1540. In the  \nmeantime, based on the earlier request made by Lebne-Dengel in 1535, Portuguese  \nsoldiers arrived in the Christian court in 1541. However, in August 1542, the Christian army was defeated in Ofla, in today's southern Tigray. In the battle, about two hundred Portuguese and their leader Christopher da Gama were killed. \nOn the part of the Christians,  under the leadership of Emperor Gelawdewos,  \npreparations for the decisive clash were planned.

The Imam was killed in the battle and the defeated troops of Adal, including \nthe wife of the Imam, Bati dil-Wonberra, retreated back to Adal.\nGelawdewos was certain that the nobility and his soldiers were faithful to him  \nshortly after the war. The king regained control of practically the whole  \nnorthern and central plateau as a result. Highlands Muslim populations submitted to  \nGelawdewos. To encourage national reconciliation and establish a restoration of cordial relations with the Muslim world, he was tolerant toward them.  However, controlling the  \nMuslim-dominated areas was not an easy task. Under the leadership of Nur Ibn  \nal-Waazir Mujahid, Adal was ready to wage war against the Christian nation for  \nrevenge. In 1559 Emir Nur's army clashed with Gelavdevos and killed the king himself.  \nThe wars between the Christian kingdom and Adal Sultanate had many impacts. Due to \nthe wars, both states were exhausted and weakened at the end of the war due to the loss of enormous wealth, both human and material. This in turn had paved for easy penetration and success of the Oromo population movement. People from different cultural groups intermarry and engage in linguistic and religious interactions.\nBetween 1529 and 1543 the Sultante had dominated not only the Christian kingdom, but \nalso parts of the Horn. Nevertheless, in 1543, the Christian Kingdom was successful in regaining its freedom. During this period Islam was able to gain new converts in parts of the heartland of the Christian kingdom. This resulted in the intermingling of the Christian and Muslim peoples of the region. "

Thus, this section explores the history of some of the states (as  \nillustrations) in the period under consideration. \nIn central and southern parts of the region, there were states and peoples with  \nindigenous religions. Those were Damot, Kafa, Ennarya, Bizamo, Walaita, Yem,  \nKambata, the Gurage chiefdoms, and the Agaw kingdom of Gojjam. Damot was probably \nthe earliest of these states. It seems to have existed as early as the Aksumite period over an  \nextensive territory. This territory includes the areas south of the Blue Nile River. Damot might have possibly extended to include the areas of Enareya, Bizamo and Walaita. Among the rulers of this state, the well-known was called Motalami. Motalami was converted to  \nChristianity by Abune Tekle Haymanot in the late thirteenth century AD.\n The rulers of the Solomonic dynasty began attempts to bring this state under their control in the last quarter of the thirteenth century. Finally, King Amde Seyon annexed it into the Christian state in 1316. Information on the history of Bizamo is scanty. Nevertheless, there are pieces of evidence that it had early connections with Damot. The kingdoms of Enareya, Kafa, and Wolaita also had similar connections with Damot.\nThe Kingdom of Enareya probably existed in the area north of the Gojeb River.

Kafa was known at least since \nthe end of the fourteenth century. However, it was not mentioned in any of the Christian documents. It was an independent kingdom from the Christian High land state.\nThe state of Wolaita might have also been part of the Kingdom of Damot since its  \nconnection with Damot was strong. The ruling dynasty of Wolaita was known as  \nWolaita-Malla.  Wolaita was mentioned as one of the areas paying tribute to the Christian king  \nYeshaq (r. 1413 - 1430). It might have also continued as part of the Christian empire up to \nthe wars of Ahmad ibn Ibrahim. \nSeveral states existed in central Ethiopian highlands. Among them: Kambata, the Gurage \nchiefdoms and the Agaw kingdom of Gojjam. The Gurage chiefdoms, on the other hand, were concentrated in the area west of Lake Zeway and the highlands of Dawaro. Its local chiefs used the titles of Azmach, Abegaz and Nigus.\nThe Agaw kingdom of Gojjam was mentioned in the Christian historical documents. They established the Agwa kingdom of Gojjam, located to the south of Lake Tana and  \nexercised strong control over the Lake and its islands. Many Christian kings made  \nsuccessive attempts to bring it under their control. They advanced to the hinterlands using the Lake Tana region as a steppingstone. Finally, Amde Tseyon (r. 1314-1344)  \nincorporated Gojjam into the Christian state in the early fourteenth century. \nIn the reign of Amde Tsiyon, a Christian preacher at one of the island monasteries at Lake \nTana named Abba Za Yohannes marched southwards to the Agaw inhabited villages and \nattempted to evangelize the people. However, the Agaw community of the island and the surrounding was already converted to Christianity during the Zagwe periods.\nHowever, the same people south of the Lake were predominantly followers of the  \nindigenous religion. Therefore, Abba ZeYohannes\u2019s attempt to preach the gospel over \nTana areas immediately led to open conflict between Zhan Chuhay and the Christian  \nKingdom. Zhan Chuhay was then ruler of the Agaw Kingdom that extended as far southeast as  \nAmadamit Mountain in what is today Quarit. He ordered his army to arrest Abba  \nZeYohannes, and the monk was detained at Amadamit Mountain. Amde Tsiyon, in \nhis turn, dispatched his forces to the Agaw kingdom. Zhan Chuhay was killed in the  \ncampaign, and Abba ZeYohannes was freed. This marked the incorporation of the Gojjam Agaw kingdom into the Christian highland Kingdom. \nHowever, the title of \u201cKing of Gojjam\u201d was maintained by local rulers under the  \nChristian state. Since its conquest, Christianity was introduced to Gojjam. Its people were  \nChristianized, and Churches and monasteries were built in the Kingdom. "

These have played important roles in shaping the history of  \nEthiopia and the Horn.\nThe Argoba, Afar, and Somali population movements occurred as a result of the  \nconfilicts between the Christian kingdoms and the Sultanate of Adal in the late fifteenth \nand early sixteenth centuries.  However, the largest population movement and expansion  \nduring this period was that of the Oromo.\nArgoba: The territory of Argoba lay in the region where the major caravan trade routes \npass to Zeila. Thus they were major agents of trade and Muslim Sultanates formation in the Horn such as Shewa and Ifat.  The Argoba\u2019s homeland was also a target of the  \nChristian Kingdom\u2019s expansion. The Sultanate of Ifat, in which the Argoba were  \ndominant, became the center of against Christian kingdom. The Argoba joined the Afar and Somali against the Christian Kingdom. Hence the Argoba were affected by the  \nconsequences of wars since 13\nth century.  The lasting effect of the wars can be perceived \nfrom the dispersed settlement of the Argoba people.\nAfar: Due to drought, the Afar moved towards the east until they reached the middle \nAwash. Trade routes linking the ports in the Horn passed through the Afar's territory.  As a result, the region was the centre of competition between the Christian kingdoms and the Muslim sultanates to control the trade routes.  Besides being actors in the conflict, the conflict inevitably pressurized the Afar to move in different directions to avoid the Lesson learning outcomes\nAt the end of this lesson, learners will be able to: \n\u2022\texplain the causes and consequences of population movement in Ethiopia and the Horn. \n\u2022\tdraw a sketch map of Ethiopia to indicate the main directions of Oromo  \npopulation\u2019s movement.\nBrainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat is population movement?

In the sixteenth century, their pastoral economy helped them survive the  \ndestructive effects of the wars. \nSomali:  Their land was located in an area that was crossed by important trade routes during \nmedieval period.   Likewise, before the wars of Imam Ahmed al-Ghazi, there was strong  \ndemographic pressure from the Somali. The population movement of the Somali was a strong force behind the military strength of the Imam. However, the population movement \nof the Somali did not last for long as they returned to their home base following the defeat of Imam Ahmed in 1543.\nOromo: The Oromos are an indigenous Cushitic people of Ethiopia and the \nHorn of Africa. When Aksum came into history, it was quite clear that the  \nOromo also occupied a considerable part of the land in Ethiopia and the Horn of Africa.  \nAccording to Oromo oral traditions, the original homeland of the Oromo before the  \nsixteenth century was the south-eastern part of Ethiopia's highlands. The political and  \nreligious centre of the Oromo settlement area was Madda Walabu, located on the  \nBale-Sidama borderlands. A combination of natural and manmade factors caused the movement of Oromo  \npopulation in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. These are: \n\u2022\tdemographic pressure and the subsequent need for land to accommodate the growing \nhuman and livestock population. \n\u2022\tthe conflict between the Christian Kingdoms and Muslim Sultanates was the other factor that forced the Oromo to leave the lands they inhabited and move to other areas. \nThe combination of these factors resulted in a dramatic and large-scale population  \nmovement of the Oromo people in the sixteenth century."

The Karayu, Marawa, Ittu, Humbana, Akachu, Wollo, and Arsi clans made up the Barentu. During 1522 and 1618 saw the time of movement and  \nexpansion. In the Ethiopian region, the movement was mostly set in two directions. The Barentu headed  northeast as they left. North-westerly was the direction taken by the Borana.  \nOutside the Ethiopian region, they also moved in the directions of Kenya and Somalia. There were two phases to the movement. The first phase was the early sixteenth-century era of a modest and gradual movement. The second phase lasted from the middle of the sixteenth century to 1618. The use of force was used to carry out this massive movement.\nThe Oromo people headed north and passed through a corridor between Mount  \nWalabu and Lake Abaya. They turned westward when they got to a point halfway between \nLakes Abaya and Hawassa. They began by crossing the Bilatte River and moving in that  \ndirection. They then traveled northward toward the lake's region of the Rift Valley.\nFrom 1522 to 1618, the Oromo fought twelve Butta wars.

In addition to the wars between the Christian Kingdoms and Muslim  \nSultanates, the organisation of the Oromo under the Gadaa system played a crucial \nrole in the success of the Oromo population movement. \nIn their movement into various regions, different Oromo branches established Gadaa \ncentres. These centers were: \n\u2022\tOda Nabee of Tulama (East Shewa), \n\u2022\tOda Roba of Sikko-Mando (Arsi), \n\u2022\tOda Bultum of Itu-Humbenna (Hararge), \n\u2022\tOda Bisil of Mecha (West Shewa) and \n\u2022\tOda Bulluq of Jawwi Mecha (Horro-Guduru).\nOther places, which became Gadaa centres, were Gayo of Sabbo-Gona, Me'e Bokko of \nGuji, Oda Dogi of Ilu, Oda Hulle of Jimma, Oda Garad of Wallo, etc.\nGadaa leaders such as Dawe Gobbo of Borana, Anna Sorra of Guji, Makko-Bili of  \nMecha, Babbo Koyye of Jimma and others established Gadaa centres. They laid down \ncardinal laws in their respective areas.  \nHowever, various Oromo groups kept their relations through the office of Abba Muda \n(the father of anointment) seated at Madda Walabu and formed alliances during times of  \ndifficulty. Besides, they obeyed similar culture and law (Seera) by sending their delegates \nto Madda-Walabu, the central chaffe, until the pan-Oromo assembly was forbidden in 1900 due to the political influence Ethiopian state. \nThe Oromo population movement and expansion was successful for several reasons:- \n\u2022\tIn the first place, the Gadaa system provided training and military organisation, which \ncontributed much to the movement's success. \n\u2022\tBesides, almost all members of society participated in wars. \nIt was a large-scale expansion so difficult to stop. The Oromo made wide and good use of \nthe horse at the time of the expansion. One important Oromo institution which seems to have facilitated the expansion was adaptation. Moreover, the movement took place when the Christian kingdom and Sultanate of Adal were exhausted and weakened due to the wars of the first half of the sixteenth century.\nThe Oromo population movement and expansion brought about fundamental  \nchanges in the Ethiopian region.

The expanding Oromo destroyed the old states of the  \nkingdoms of Damot, Bizamo and Ennarya. The peoples of Damot and Gafat were  \neither assimilated with the Oromo or forced to move out from the south to the north and  \nintermingled with the Christian community of the area. The Christian kingdom was  \ngreatly disturbed by the Oromo population movement. The territorial and financial \nstrengths of the kingdom were highly weakened. It was forced to shift its political centre from Shewa in the south to the Lake Tana area north and Gondar. \nThe Sultanate of Adal was reduced to the walled town of Harar as the result of the  \nOromo expansion. This was mainly because after the death of Imam Ahmed, the Muslims \nof Adal were reorganised under Emir Nur Mujahid. The Emir launched an offensive war \nagainst the Christian kingdom. In 1559, Nur Mujahid defeated and killed Gelawdewos in the Awash valley. Nevertheless, he could not pursue his victory over the Christian forces because the Oromo forces had already reached the Harar area at the time. \nSo, he returned to Adal to defend it from falling to the Oromo. However, since most of \nHarar was occupied by the Oromos, he just built a wall around the town of Harar, which is known as the Jegol Gimb. This led to the end of an age-old conflict between Adal and the Christian kingdom. Following their movement and expansion, the Oromo became  \nlargely sedentary agriculturists. In time, the great majority of them also adopted  \nChristianity and Islam.

It was an egalitarian system in which \nan assembly or a chaffe of the ruling Gadaa class provided leadership for the Oromo  \nnation. It was developed from knowledge gained by community experience over  \ngenerations. The system regulates the community's political, economic, social, and religious  \nactivities dealing with conflict resolution (arara), reparation (Guma), and protecting  \nwomen's rights. It serves as a mechanism for enforcing moral conduct, building social \ncohesion, and expressing forms of community culture. Moreover, the Gadaa system was an institution through which the Oromo socially organised themselves, administered their affairs, defended their territories, maintained law order, and managed their economies. The Oromo had practiced the Gadaa system long before the sixteenth-century movement of the Oromo.  \nThe Gadaa system constituted elements of democracy such as periodic succession \nand power-sharing to prevent a one-man rule. Other principles of the system included  \nrepresentation of all lineages, clans and confederacies. The Gadaa system organised the Oromo society into age grades and generation sets  \ndelineating members' social, political, and economic responsibilities. In the system, ten \nage grades and five classes operated in parallel. The system provided a socio-political framework that institutionalised relationships between seniors and juniors and egalitarian relations among grade members. The system helped the members of age-sets to develop a consistent and stable sense of self and others. Sons joined the first grade as members of Gadaa class (generation class or set) forty years after their fathers and were initiated into the next higher grade every eight years. In the system, eight years represented one Gadaa \nperiod, five Gadaa periods or 40 years represented one generation, and nine generations \nrepresented an era. The political philosophy of Gadaa is based on three main values: \nterms of eight years, balanced opposition between parties, and power-sharing between higher and lower levels. In the Gadaa system, generation, age, sex, and class were the \nguiding criteria in labour division and the sharing of responsibilities.\nGadaa system was interrupted and revitalised during various eras because of various  \ninternal and external factors. For instance, the Borana-Barentu Gadaa was instituted  \nafter an interruption for nearly two generations. It was revived in 1450 at Madda Walabu, Brainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat do you know about the Gadaa System?  "

The Mote \nexercised political and administrative authority in consultation with the council of  \nelders called Songo. Songo members would raise any agenda for discussion within the  \ncouncil and submit their decisions to the Mote for approval. Although there was no written  \nconstitution, the rules were known by the heart through generations and practiced  \naccordingly.  \nFigure 7.2 The Sidama Luwa system and their assembly, \n(source: static.dw.com)\nThe Woma was the cultural and ritual leader in Sidama society. The criteria for his  \nelection were his ability as a peacemaker, bodily perfection, expressive ability, wisdom, \nand caution. The Woma could not participate in war or cattle raiding as he was considered a man of peace. In addition, the Woma handled cultural matters such as offering sacrifices \nto the spirits. He also performed other rituals such as circumcision and marriage. The Sidama were grouped into two major clans called Bushe and Maldea. These are, in turn, subdivided into different sub-clans. \nSeniority was closely related to the age cycles of luwa. The luwa structure had many  \ncommonalities with the Oromo Gadaa system and played a fundamental role in initiation \nrites and maintaining authority roles. There are two terms used to refer to the elderly,  \ngercho and cimessiccho. The first term refers to a person's age- a person with grey hair. The other term refers to an elder who has undergone the rite of passage, the initiation into the status of elderhood. The timing of this rite is a function of the luwa age-grade system. The luwa identity had repeatedly been expressed as a basic traditional Sidama value. "

Men of the same luwa, age-cycle group, have powerful bonding. Each age group selects their Gadaanna, leader, who will represent their generation throughout eight years. The passage into elderhood, which gives a man the status of cimessima, takes place during the rites of his generation, the luwa to which he belongs. A son cannot undergo the initiation ritual to enter the cimessima, which includes circumcision berchima, before his father. He has to wait for the successive luwa to be initiated. According to the halal, an elder is expected to live according to the halale, the actual concept. \nTraditionally, this is a moral standard reflecting the truth by avoiding any form of \ncrime, such as stealing, perjury, corruption, injustice, and strict adherence to the highest  \nstandards of probity, integrity, honesty, and truthfulness. In this respect, they are the  \nrepository of the tribal heritage, passed on from generation to generation.\nThe daily lives have traditionally been organised around a social network within the olla, \nvillage or mine manni, the family unit.

The woma of the different subtribes within the Sidama make up the woma-songo, the assembly of subtribal kings or judges. It is the highest traditional authority. In addition, there are differentiated lower songo  \nassemblies, which have different areas of authority and responsibility. However, gender and age are limitations to participation. Only the elders and only the men have a say in these  \nassemblies. The sera are defined as the ruling truth, referred to as halale. Halale  \nproclaimed by the elders is hard to challenge and is often a base for \u201cforced\u201d consensus. As opposed to individualism, decision making in the assemblies is always with one voice, and the consensus is valued over the open confrontation of opposing ideas.\nThe gare-songo is the next level. This is the council of the mote, who are the kings of the \ngare, the maximal lineage segment (a sub-division of the subtribe). The mote is partly an inherited position, but there may be a choice between the sons of the former mote. The gare-songo deals with matters closer to daily life than the woma-songo. It may, for  \nexample, be involved in making a disobedient son obedient to his father. It also deals with matters of loans and serves as a local court, and can impose penalties. People who do not pay their penalties in cash, in-kind, or community service obligations may be  \nexcommunicated from the community.\nWithin the smaller agnatic units such as at the haracha level, there are also songo \n (assemblies), headed by the muriccha. The haracha comprises a cluster of agnatic \nunits, olla, villages, sharing sera. There is a songo at the olla level, and the head of that  \nassembly is also called a muriccha. At both levels, the haracha and the olla, the  \nmurricha are primarily in charge of administrating the services related to deaths and funerals.  \nHowever, because of the high authority associated with these indispensable ceremonies in the community, the murricha may also be called upon to become involved in other significant community activities. The principle of seniority and communal relationship is still strong at the neighbourhood and household level. Observations confirm that the elders still have a powerful influence on the daily life of ordinary people. In particular, the murricha was referred to as an authority. Gender roles are traditionally defined. \nThe sera in the Sidama community have traditionally ruled a web of relations and  \ninterrelations. Sera is a set of local cultural norms or codes regulating the communal  \nsocial structure and interaction. Traditionally, sera are almost an ethical and moral codex. \nIt may be seen as unwritten law, but it constitutes at the same time the morality and the conscience of the individual and the community.

During the reign of Fura, the status of males was degraded below the status of the female. Fura was said to have cruel,  \nmistrusted men and asked them to carry out various orders that were  \ndifficult or degrading to execute.

It is based on an age system and has similarities with the Gadaa system of \nthe neighbouring Gujji Oromo. The leaders of the ballee were elected by the general council called Yaa  from the ruling age group. The yaa council was the supreme authority \namong the Gedeo. All ballee officials were elected by the yaa. The most important of these  \nofficials was the Abba Gadaa, who would give political, social and ritual leadership to the \nwhole Gedeo. Each of the three Gedeo territorial units was administered by a roga. These were responsible for the Abba Gadaa. \nKonso \nThe Konso people are located in a primarily hilly area in southwest Ethiopia, to the east of the Rift valley. They are surrounded by the Sagan River to the south, the Gumayde Plains to the north, the Amaro Mountains to the east, and the Woito River to the east.  They speak an East Highland Cushitic language spoken by their neighbours, the Burji, Dirashe and Gawada. Konso traditions have close cultural relations with some of these neighbours. For example, they used to live in a region called Liban together with the Borana Oromo, Burji and Dirashe before they departed and settled in their present locations.\nKonso economy is dependent on mixed agriculture. They produce grains, the most  \nimportant of which is sorghum and millet. The region receives low and erratic rainfall, \nwhich is ideal for the crops. They also cultivate a tree crop locally called shelgeda. It is \nlike moringa whose leaves are consumed as cabbage.  Konsos have also developed an intensive agriculture system through time. They have terraced their hillsides with stones. This practice has made Konso agriculture sustainable. \nThe Konso had a decentralized political structure. As a result, various people and groups \nshared authority. The poqalla, a priest, was one of these people. He was in charge of the clan's welfare and served as a peacemaker during disputes. The council of elders and members of the generation set known as tella were additional groups involved in  \ngovernment.\nUntil the late nineteenth century, the Konso people lived in walled villages  \n(paletas). There was no central authority who acted as a sovereign power over the three  \nregions. Instead, each village was ruled by a council of elders called hayyota, who were  \nselected through the direct participation of male members of the village.  Membership to the  \ncouncil was not hereditary but rotated every eighteen years. At the core of the  \nsocio-political organisation of the Konso appear to be the clan or lineage group and  \ngeneration set, Tselta. The Konso were divided into nine exogamous clans:  "

The Tselta had a fixed cycle of years starting from birth. However, they varied \nacross villages-eighteen in Karat, nine in Takati and five in Turo. The primary function of the generation set was informing the responsibilities expected of each age group.  \nBurji\nThe Burji clans belong to one of two moieties named Dashcha and Jiremalecha. Dashcha includes Goda, Banbal, Dedebana, Yab, Qedado, Umma, Hirola, etc. At the same time, Jire Malecha comprises Gammaye, Tamay, Wotesh, Mangodo, Anabura, Karamana and others. \nTraditional Burji administration had an elective system known as basha (shumet). Under \nthe basha system, appointments took place in different ceremonies in which official titles were conferred. They included officials titled woma in the womis ceremony, kings in  \nroyal coronations, dayna officials in daynoma ceremonies and masha in other  \nappointment ceremonies. The Burji possessed two types of woma, each with appropriate womiso or royal coronation ceremonies. One was a hereditary spiritual woma, while the other was a popular elective political elite or woma. The latter came to power through a plebiscite based on personal ability and integrity. The hereditary spiritual woma was known as gan. There were two types: saganaka gan and banbalinka gan. The former served as a  \nrainmaker while the latter was believed to possess powers to control and prevent wars, crop pests and disease.\nThe eldest son succeeded his deceased woma's father. The body of the deceased woma was \ntaken out of his home via a hole pierced through the walls on the rear side of the house. The deceased's wrist bracelet was removed and transferred to the successor. The latter started his reign by performing all appropriate public duties. The woma was appointed as a king based upon the number of his supporters, degree of wealth oratory and fulfilment of social criteria contained in the traditional system of appointments of the basha principle.\n \n1.\u2002Mention at least one ethnic group that practices an egalitarian  \n     democracy.  \n\uf03f"

This  \ndynasty used the legend of Queen Sheba's union with King Solomon of  \nIsrael. The result of their union was Menelik I, whom they consider as the 'first  \nSolomonic King'. However, this legend has only helped to legitimize state power for  \nsuccessive generations until 1974. It dominated not only because of legitimized \nstate power but also due to economic and military strength.\nOnce Islam reached Ethiopia and the Horn, multiple Muslim sultanates were  \nestablished along the long-distance trading routes. A number of Muslim  \nSultanets were established along the Zeila trade route, which served as the main \nroute for Islam into the interior of Ethiopia. There were a series of conflicts  \nbetween the Christian, Muslim and other states. The result shows how the various  \npeoples and states of the whole region of Ethiopia and the Horn were highly interrelated with each other in many ways.  \nIn central and southern parts of the region, there were states and peoples with \nindeginous religions. Those were Damot, Kafa, Ennarya, Bizamo, Walaita, Yem, Kambata, the Gurage chiefdoms, and the Agaw kingdom of Gojjam. The movements of people from one place to another have played essential roles in shaping the history of Ethiopia and the Horn. As far back sources tell,  \npopulation movements occurred in the Horn for various reasons, in varied scales and followed different directions. People move from place to place due to pull and push factors. Specifically, people move out from their habitats in search of  \nresources and a better living environment. In Ethiopia and the Horn, the  \ncauses of the movements could be attributed to the region's long socio-political  \nconditions involving military conflicts, drought and demographic factors. \nThe Gadaa system was divided into age groups. It was an egalitarian system in \nwhich the Oromo nation was led by an assembly or chaffe of the ruling Gadaa \nclass. It arose from the knowledge gained through generations of community experience. The major outcomes of population movements during the period under consideration include religious, ethnic and linguistic interactions and  \nintermingling of peoples. Specifically, this has resulted in the intermarriage of peoples, change of abode, original culture and evolution of new identities.Unit Summary\uf026"

During this  \nperiod, political power was  \ndecentralised across the country. The unit also discusses the history of  \ndifferent peoples who had their local states in the southern half of the  \nEthiopian region. In the first section, you will learn about some of the  \nindependent polities that flourished in western, southern and eastern Ethiopia.  The lessons of this unit describe the  \ndifferent ways in which economic,  \npolitical and social process was  \norganised in polities. The differences and similarities that existed among them were underlined. It also treats  \nsocieties that are not so highly  \norganised in the region. The next  section of the unit describes  \nchanges and continuities in the Christian  \nkingdom from the mid-16\nth to the \nmid-19th centuries. It starts with the  \nrecovery of the Christian highland \nkingdom from the defeat it faced in the hands of the Sultanate of Adal.  \nNevertheless, its efforts at revival were disturbed later on by elements of regional power struggle. This  \nperiod of regionalism was called the  \nZemene-Mesafent (period of  \nregional warlords). It deals mainly with the efforts of the Christian Kingdom to consolidate its power and how it  \nentered into chaos in the mid-19\nth  \ncentury.

According to the people's traditions, it was known at least since the end of the fourteenth century. This part of Ethiopia receives heavy rainfall, has dense forests and fertile soil. It was inhabited by peoples related to the Bench. Kafa was ruled by a king whose title was called Tato. The insignia of the kingship is interesting and important. They \nconsist of twelve objects, many of them made of gold. Especially, the king's crown was in the form of a helmet made of gold and silver, with a triple phallus of gold in front.\nFigure 8.1 Crown of the Kingdom of Kafa, (adopted from Laphiso \nG. Delebo, 1985:18)\nThe Kingship was hereditary. An advisory council of nobles called Mikkerecho  \nassisted the king.

It was an independent kingdom from the Christian High land state. Kafa was influenced by the Christian kingdom.

However, Kafa survived the Oromo  \npressure and disconnected its relation with the Christian Kingdom. Kafa governed itself \nas an independent state until the late 19th century. \nKafa was one of the resourceful kingdoms that greatly contributed to Ethiopian trade. The economy of Kafa was based on agriculture and trade. Coffee said to have been originated in Kafa was the main crop, and enset is the major food crop of the Kafa kingdom. The main trade items were ivory, mask, honey, coffee, enslaved people, and gold. \nKafa had considerable trade relations with the neighbouring Oromo and Shewan states \nin the nineteenth century. In addition, it had a tradition of digging deep trenches called  \nKuripo as a defensive barrier. This strong internal political organisation and defense  \nsystem enabled the kingdom to maintain its independence for an extended period. \nThe Kafa rulers adopted the title tato from the neighbouring kingdom of  \nEnnarya whose ruling elite moved to the south of Gojeb River due to the Oromo pressure.  \nChristianity was also introduced to Kafa from Enaria state.

Its king Motolami \nwas traditionally said to have been the founder of the Wolaita-Mala ruling family until the Tigre-Mala replaced it in the late fifteenth century. The Tigre-Mala lasted in the late 19\nth \ncentury. \nAccording to tradition, the Dawuro state was established in the 16th century by an  \nimmigrant clan called Kawuka. By about 1700, the Kawuka dynasty had created a big \nstate of Dawuro. Among the rulers of the Kawuka dynasty of Dawuro, Kati Erashu (r. \n1719-1775) and Kati Halala (r. 1775-1835) were famous. The Dawuro administrative  \nhierarchy in ascending order includes Huduga, Abaliya, Danna, Guuda, Erasha, Woraba, \nBushasha and Kate. The khati of Konta controlled and supervised his subordinate officials \nwith the titles of Gana, Torancha, Woraba, Erasha, Guda, and Dana. \nThe Kawo of Gamo was distinct. The Gamo organised between 40 to 55 politically  \nautonomous units called dere. Each dere administered itself independently and had a  \nhereditary ruler, kawo. The dere assembly called duletha was the major administrative \nbody of the Gamo people. The assembly was made up of elected officials called halaka. \nThese representatives were the real administrators of the deres. They decided on all the major decisions affecting the lives of the dere. The states of Wolaita, Gamo and Gofa had \ntributary relations with the Christian kingdom until it was cut off following the movement of the Oromo in the 16\nth century. However, they successfully resisted Oromo pressure. The \nadministration was hierarchical among the Oyda people, with ranks of officials bearing honorific titles of Khati, Chamicha, Bitane and Erasha. \nThe Chamicha preserved peace and security, and even he would take the king's task in the \nevent of malpractice. The eldest son succeeds the khati upon his death or abdication. The \nZayse king belonged to the Zulessa clan. Subordinate to khati, there were seven public administrators of equal power with the title of maga. Like the khati, the position of maga was hereditary. \nThe realm of Gamo was divided into seven different kingdoms, each of which was ruled \nby a king (kawo). The king delivered the most important verdicts, and his decisions were binding. The king was the supreme head of the entire administrative apparatus with the power to appoint and dismiss officials under him. These include Woraba, Erasha, Guda, Gana, and Mochena (Mura). Likewise, the kawo, the subordinate officials, had the power \nto appoint and dismiss junior officials under them."

Oromo Monarchies: Gibe States\nThe Oromo had an egalitarian and republican socio-political organisation system known \nas the Gadaa, which is based on age groups. As discussed earlier, the socio-political  \norganisation of the Oromo was based on the Gadaa system. However, following their \nexpansion in the Gibe and Wallaga regions, the system went under changes in the early nineteenth century. In such a way, the Oromo gradually abandoned the Gadaa system and \nbegan to form monarchial states in these regions. \nThe Oromo population movement and expansion brought about fundamental changes in \nthis part of the Ethiopian region. It put pressure on Damot, Gafat and Bizamo, causing the local inhabitants to assimilate with the Oromo or flee north of Abay River. \nDifferent views are held regarding the cause for the transformation of the Gadaa system. \nOne of the main factors was the changing of Oromos from a pastoral to agrarian mode \nof life and the class differentiation that this brought about. The continuous wars that the Oromo waged during their movement and expansion were another factor. The war tended to strengthen the powers of the a bba dula (the war-leader in the Gadaa system) at the \nexpense of the abba boku (head of the Oromo society). \nThey controlled land, markets and trade routes, and used much of the war booties to built up their private armies. Finally, they were able to gain control over their respective clans and regions and began to assume the title of moti, meaning king. \nThis evolution towards monarchical power was manifested in two regions. The first was \nin the area of the Gibe River, hence they were named Gibe monarchies. This process occurred first in the Gibe region in the early nineteenth century, where five small Oromo states Limmu-Ennarya, Jimma, Gumma, Gomma and Gera emerged. The same process was repeated in Wallaga later in that century, where Leqa Naqamte and Leqa Qellem were formed. \nLimmu Ennarya was the earliest Gibe state. Its center was Saqqa. This state was  \nestablished on the territories of the older state of Ennarya. Its strategic location in the \nregion enabled it to control the long-distance trade routes that linked the region with the north. As a result, it became the strongest state in the region during the first half of the nineteenth century. The strongest ruler of Limmu Ennarya was Abba Bagibo, or Ibsa (r. \n1825-1861), which marked the peak of Limmu-Ennarya's ascendancy"

On the other hand, Gera became well known around 1835 during its strongest ruler, Tullu Gunji, a popular warrior king and a good administrator. It was in great conflict with the state of Gumma.\nA distinctive feature of the Gibe states was their conversion from indigenous religions to \nIslam in the first half of the nineteenth century.\nB. Oromo Monarchies: Leqa States\nBesides the Gibe states, there were two main centres of monarchical power in Wallaga in the early nineteenth century. These were the states of Leqa Naqamte and Leqa Qellem. A leader called Bakare Godana established the state of Leqa Naqamte, which grew even more powerful under his successors Moroda and Kumsa Moroda.

Sheikdoms and Peoples of Beni-Shangul Gumuz.\nSheikdoms and Peoples of Beni-Shangul Gumuz inhabited the narrow lowland strip \nalong the Ethio- Sudanese border in the west. These peoples are mainly speakers of the  \nNilo- Saharan language family. This area was a gold-producing region since Punt and commonly identified as the Silent Commerce, probably due to language barriers between merchants. Gumuz society practiced shifting cultivation as chief subsistence strategies on a small scale in the pre-19\nth  century. The Gumuz used slash-and-burn agriculture not only \nas a system of farming but also as a natural resource management system. Slash-and-burn agriculture has a long history that appeared during the Neolithic period and gradually  \nexpanded into different parts of the world. The Gumuz farmers also identified the fertility of the soil by observing the color of soil and its drainage capacity.\nThe Gumuz had a positive attitude towards the forests in their surroundings. The  \nGumuz natural resource management was tied to their belief system; they believed that  \nnatural resources are the best gifts of Yama (supreme deity). Moreover, they had  \nindigenous knowledge on how to manage their natural resources.The Gumuz used fire as an essential tool for hunting, providing new vegetation growth \nfor their herds and diminishing the ravages of the tsetse fly. The Gumuz sow sorghum on the first virgin plot prepared through clearing. They sow millet and sorghum again for the second round on the same plot. For the third round, they sow cotton based on a peasant's need. Gumuz do not cultivate a single plot more than three times. Thus, after the third round of cultivation, this plot is left to become fallow for the regeneration of the forest. The Shinasha were one of the groups of Gonga people who established a powerful  \nkingdom in southwestern Ethiopia before the 16\nth century. \nHowever, demographic and political pressures since the 16th century pushed them further \nto the west to the territories they occupied at present. In addition, the 16th century Oromo expansion weakened and divided the Gonga kingdom into different groups. The southern group was represented by the Kafa people, while the Shinasha people represented the northern group. The Gonga people lived along the sides of the Blue Nile, extending up to the Ethiopian escarpment long before the reign of Susenyos (1607-1632). \nShifting cultivation was one of the subsistence strategies of Shinasha, Gumuz and  \nBenishangul. The Shinasha shifting cultivation was based on cooperative labour work \ncoordinated and led by a community leader known as Dawa Nasho. Shinasha followed a similar shifting plot and crop rotation pattern with the Gumuz. After third round  \ncultivation on a single plot, they left fallow.

As a result, some members of the ruling family of Ifat retreated farther to Harar and established the Sultanate of Adal around 1380. As a result, Harar served as a political center of the Sultanate of Adal up to the sixteenth century. \nThe Sultanate of Adal was reduced to the walled town of Harar as the result of the Oromo \nexpansion. After the death of Imam Ahmed, the Muslims of Adal were reorganised under \nEmir Nur Mujahid. The Emir launched an offensive war against the Christian kingdom. In 1559 Nur Mujahid defeated and killed Gelawdewos in the Awash valley. However, he could not continue with his victory over the Christian forces because the Oromo forces had already reached the Harar area at the time. So, he returned to Adal to defend it from falling to the Oromo. However, since most of Harar was occupied by the Oromo, he just built a wall around the town of Harar, which is known as the Jegol wall. The walls  \nsurrounding this city, considered \u201cthe fourth holy city\u201d of Islam, were built between the 13\nth and 16th centuries and served as a protective barrier. \nFollowing the Oromo movement and expansion, the Walasma rulers abandoned it and moved to Aussa. Then, the emirate of Harar was established under a local Harari dynasty in the middle of the seventeenth century. The founder of this dynasty was Emir Ali Ibn Dawd (r. 1647-1662).

In each sultanate, the group's unique  \nculture and customs flourished. Traditionally each sultanate was made up of several  \nvillages. In the early 14th century, however, the kings of the Christian kingdom associated \nthe Afar with the medieval Adal Sultanate. However, the \u201cAfar Triangle\u201d maintained a  \nconfederation of sultanates. Among these were the Sultanate of Aussa, Sultanate of Bidu, \nSultanate of Tadjoura, Sultanate of Rahaito, and Sultanate of Goobad. \nAussa was ruled by the local Afar chiefs who had the title of Sultan.  Later, the  \nWalasma rulers of Adal ruled Aussa after they had left Harar in 1577. In 1577, the Adal leader \nImam Muhammed Ga\u2019as (r. 1573-1583), moved his capital from Harar to Aussa in Afar. In 1647, the rulers of the Emirate of Harar broke away to form their polity. However, Harari Imams continued to have a presence in the southern Afar. Aussa occupied relatively larger  \nterritorial limits than other sultanates in Afar. \nThe Aussa was weakened after a century. In 1734 Sultan Kadafo Hanfarie Aydahis  \n(1733-1790) of the Mudaito clan established the Mudaito sultanate. The Mudaito clan \nruled the sultanate of Aussa consequently for 241 years from Sultan Kadafo Hanfarie \nAydahis to Sultan Ali Mirah II (1944-1974). The sultanate of Bidu held the second level \nto Aussa in military power. The Sultanate of Rahaito is the oldest in the region. Although it was the smallest in territorial limits, the Sultanate of Tadjourah exceeded all sultanates in Afar in terms of urban features. \nThe Afar people had an independent traditional political system. Each Afar Sultan was \nthe religious and political leader of his clan. They had overall control of trade activities \nand imposed tax on caravans. The Afar successively resisted the persistent intrusions by neighbouring highlanders. This shows that there had been long-lasting rivalry between the Afar sultanates and the Christian highland kingdom for economic resources and  \nsocio-political hegemony.  \nExternally, its location on the coast exposed it to attacks from foreigners such as Ottoman \nTurks, Egypt, and French.  Throughout history, the Afar people have strongly resisted domination by others, and this tradition continues into the 21\nst century. They did not let \nforeigners in, and thus, no European crossed their territory without claiming the right of hospitality. For example, they ambushed the Egyptian army led by a Swiss Werner Muzinger in 1875 into the sands of Afar.\n "

When compared to each other, the \u201cYejju dynasty\u201d was the leading power during the Zemen-Mesafint with the center at Debre-Tabor. \nThe Yejju dynasty strengthened its power during its strongest ruler Ras Gugsa (1803-\n1825). The two successive Tigrian rulers, Ras Walda Sellase of Indarta (r. 1790 - \n1816) and Dejjazmach Sabagadis (r. 1822-1831), resisted Gugsa's power in the north.  \nNevertheless, he tried to neutralize them through marriage relations and diplomacy.  \nMoreover, Gugsa's military and diplomatic skills helped him exercise his power over \nthe lords of Gojjam, Wollo, Lasta, Semen, Wagara and Dambya. Following the death of  \nGugsa in 1825, the  Yejju dynasty met strong challenges from Semen and Tigrai.  \nSemen was defeated by Gugsa's son and successor, Ras Yemam (1825-1828). Ras Marye  \nsucceeded Yemam in 1828.  \nHowever, Dejjach Sabagadis of Tigrai decided to end the Yejju political domination. This \nled to the battle in 1831 of May-Aslamay, near Debre Abay, in western Tigrai. The two  \nrivals, Ras Marye and Deijjazmach Sabagadis were killed in this battle, but the final  \nvictory went to the Yejju dynasty. The ruler of Semen, Dejiazmach Wube, was rewarded \nTigrai for his contribution siding with the Yejju lords during the battle of May-Aslamay. \nHowever, the Yejju political dominance over northern Ethiopia continued for the next two decades under Ras Ali Alula or Ali II (r. 1831-1853).\nUnder Gugsa Marso (r. 1803\u20131825), Yejju dominion reached its highpoint. Yimam (r. \n1825\u20131828), Gugsa's successor, defeated Simen's Hayle-Mariam Gebre in 1826. The  \nbattle of Koso-Ber in 1827 also resulted in the death of Maru of Dambiya.

However, the Christian State shifted its capital to the Lake Tana area as a result of the pressure from Adal and the  \nsubsequent Oromo expansion of the sixteenth century. Some strong Gondarine rulers, including Iyassu I (r.1682-1706),  tried to control Shewa. To this end, they sent military expeditions to Shewa.

During this period of isolation, Shewa was disunited, and several local chiefs emerged in various parts of the region.\nNevertheless, the Shewan kingdom emerged in the area of Manz around the end of the \nseventeenth century or early eighteenth century. The founder of this Kingdom was a  \nlocal chief known as Negasi. During the Zemene-Mesafint, by safely isolating themselves \nfrom the wars in northern Ethiopia, successive rulers began to consolidate the Shewan kingdom with their centre at Ankober. The Kingdom reached its heyday under Nigus  Sahle \nSellase (r.1813-47). Sahle Sellase had brought several regions under Shewan's control and  \nmaintained law and order in the Kingdom.

The Industrial Revolution was new manufacturing processes in Europe and the United States that took place between the 18\nth and the 19th centuries. Before the \nIndustrial Revolution, the economic needs of the society were met through the farming and production of simple handmade articles. \nDuring the Industrial Revolution, manufacturing rapidly changed from mainly hand  \nproduction to the use of machinery. This transition from old modes of production to new \ntechnologically driven production brought drastic changes in the European way of life. Making cloth moved from homes to large factories. Britain also had plenty of coal and iron, which was essential to power and produced machine for the factories. \nThe consolidation of capitalism in Europe was an outcome of change in producing cloth, \niron, steel, and other manufactured goods. It was essentially the replacement of manual works by the new machine that made the large-scale production of goods possible. \nCapitalism emerged in the 16\nth to 17th centuries in Northwestern Europe, especially in \nGreat Britain. Industrial capitalism is a mode of production consisting of large, centrally \ncontrolled accumulations of capital that is used to finance production of commodities. One of the biggest factors contributing to the rise of industrial capitalism was technology. Characteristics of capitalism include capital accumulation, competitive markets, a price system, private property and the recognition of property rights, voluntary exchange and wage labour. In addition, there were new technologies that helped business: the telephone to coordinate transactions over long distances, the typewriter to speed up record-keeping, Brainstorming\n\u2022\tWhat does capitalism mean?"

Liberalism and competition in trade and the development of a free-market economy are now capitalism\u2019s main political and economic philosophies.By the 19\nth century, Britain was seen (and saw herself) as the world's workshop. However, \nthe driving forces of industrial capitalism, comparable to those experienced in the Britain, also impacted landscapes in other parts of Europe and North America. \nFigure 9.1 The first steam locomotive\nSteam engine technology underpinned the invention in the early 19th century of  \nsteam-powered locomotive engines and the development of railways. Railways made  \npossible the integration of vast continental spaces politically, culturally, and  \neconomically. For example, the British began to build railways in India in the 1850s. In North America, the first transcontinental railroad opened in 1869. As a result, the transport costs of raw materials and finished products were significantly reduced, new sources of supply became accessible, and new markets were opened.\nPolitically, industrialization had effects on the political structure due to the increase \nof power of the industries that would later become monopolies.

The rise of industrial capitalism \nthroughout the nineteenth century went hand in hand with the rise of strikes and other forms of labour protests. \nSocially, Industrial Revolution drastically changed the social life of Europe and the world. \nThis change was evident in the growth of cities and the emergence of two new social classes: the bourgeoisie and proletariat. The bourgeoisie owned the factory, machine in its raw materials and the finished goods. The proletariats sold their labour for money  \nwages.

They also had special  \nsocio-economic and political privileges. They were free from government taxation. The \npeasants and the bourgeoisie made up the Third Estate. This Estate owned little land and enjoyed no social, economic and political rights. It paid heavy taxes and was highly  \nexploited by the French government. \nThe French rulers did not call the Estates General (the gathering of the three Estates) \nfor an extended period. Since 1614, it had been ignored and was not assembled for the next one hundred and seventy-five years. During this period, France remained an  \nabsolute monarchy. This meant power was concentrated in the hands of individual monarchs.  \nFinally, on May 5, 1789, the French king, Louis XVI, faced financial bankruptcy and called for the meeting of the Estates General. At this time the French people got an  \nopportunity to express their discontent. When the Estates General met on May 5, 1789, conflict broke out between the three Estates. This was because the Third Estate tried to control the Assembly. There was a power conflict between the first two estates, on the one hand, and the third on the other. \nLouis XVI now prepared for struggle and gathered his troops from various French  \nprovinces. However, the revolt spread rapidly throughout France. The immediate action \nthat led to the French Revolution came from the poor of Paris, who found it difficult to  \novercome the high price of bread and other daily needs. On June 17, 1789, the  \nEstates-General was transformed into the National Assembly (also later called the  \nconstituent Assembly). On July 14, 1789, they stormed the Royal Castle and Prison of Bastile. The event is often called \u201cthe Storming of the Bastile\u201d.  It left Louis XVI helpless. He could not use his army because he was unsure about their loyalty.\nMoreover, many of the aristocracies were now fleeing France. In June 1791, Louis XVI \nand his family tried to escape France in disguise. However, they were recognized in a small town called Varenis and taken back as prisoners to the capital. This episode is  \nremembered as the Varnis crisis.\nThe French Assembly kept the king as a symbol until he signed the new constitution in \nSeptember 1791. As soon as the Estates-General had transformed itself into the National Assembly, it began to undertake several reforms. The greatest political achievements of "

Second, the National Assembly declared the rights of man \nand all citizens in August 1789. Third, a constitution was written in 1791. It established a limited monarchy instead of an autocracy. By this constitution, voting was not extended to all French citizens. It was allowed only to what was called active citizens, which means those who paid taxes. Those who could not fulfil the necessary financial qualifications were called passive citizens. \nThe third achievement of the National Assembly was the law against the Catholic Church. \nIt confiscated church lands and suppressed monasteries.  In the Revolution, new political forces emerged in Paris and other French cities. These political groups started to play the role of political parties since their emergence in  \n1789-90. The leadership of the French Revolution belonged to these political groups. There was disagreement between the leaders of the Revolution, as some were moderate, while others were radical. These revolutionary leaders were under siege in 1792. The king could still serve as a center of plot for the royalist counterattack and damage the  \nRevolution. Meanwhile, Austria and Prussia waged war against France, supporting the French monarchy. In April 1792, France declared war on Austria and Prussia. \nThe French people heroically fought against these external forces. The people marched \ninto Paris, singing the song known as La Marsellaise that would become the French  \nNational Anthem. They demanded that the French Republic should be proclaimed. The French army defeated the enemy forces at the battle of Valmy on September 20, 1792. Two days later, France was proclaimed a republic. Louis XVI was put on trial in  \nDecember 1792, found guilty and executed on January 21 1793. In February 1793, France again faced the joint military forces of Britain, Austria, Prussia, Holland, Spain, Sardinia and other Italian states. This anti-French coalition continued the earlier Austro-Prussian attempt to restore the French monarchy. \nThe first years of the French Republic were very stormy and bloody. As already  \nindicated above, the leaders of the French Revolution differed among themselves.   \nGirondists represented the big and middle bourgeoisie. They were called Girondists which \nwas the name of the province they came from. The Girondists represented the extreme right  \npolitical wing. The left-wing of the Revolution was led by a group called Jacobins. The Jacobins got their name from St. Jacob Church in southern France, where they made their first meeting.

This brought the period of Jacobin Revolutionary Dictatorship to an end. Hence, the authority of the French republic passed to the board of five men known as the Directory. Nevertheless, its power also came to an end with the rise of Napoleon Bonaparte.  \nResults of the French Revolution: The French Revolution destroyed the old feudal \norder in France and led to the capitalist system's development. It further led to the growth of industrial capitalism, a process started earlier by the English Bourgeoisie revolution. Although the forces of the Revolution were the poor peasants and other lower sections of the French people, its final leadership came into the hand of the bourgeoisie. It did not extend political rights to the broad mass or improve the life of the working people.\nThe French Revolution had a tremendous and far-reaching impact that probably  \ntransformed the world more than any other revolution.

The period of the rule of Napoleon in France and Europe is known as the Napoleonic Era (1799 - 1815).  \nNapoleon Bonaparte was born in 1769 on the Mediterranean Island of Corsica. At the age \nof twenty-six, he became an officer in the French army. He was a supporter and a friend of the French revolution. He used to call himself \"the son of the revolution\".

He conquered the nations of Europe, built a European Empire, and ruled it until 1814. He claimed that he fought the wars of conquest to spread the democratic ideals of the French Revolution, i.e., \u201cliberty, equality and fraternity,\u201d and for the glory of France.\nFigure 9.3  Napoleon in His Imperial Robes, oil on canvas by Francois \nGerard, 1805, (source: Encyclopaedia, Britannica)\nNapoleon was a great political and military leader. He built a Grand Army that had 600,000 troops by 1812. His army was made up of horsemen and foot soldiers, which used weapons like cannons, firearms and swords. He had capable generals.

Nevertheless, this plan never succeeded. Indeed, the British navy under Admiral Horatio Nelson defeated the allied French and Spanish naval forces at the sea Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. Napoleon imposed a blockade on British trade with  \nmainland Europe. This was known as the Continental System. The system was in force from 1806 to 1810, but it failed to force Britain into submission. British resistance against the  \nNapoleonic Empire was strong. \nNational resistance to French rule also appeared within the conquered territories \nof the Napoleonic Empire. This was because the French looted and economically  \nexploited the conquered territories. They collected taxes. They even introduced French-like  \ndepartmental (provincial) administration units in some conquered territories. Such  \nmeasures led to strong nationalist feelings among the conquered peoples. In Spain, a nationalist revolt took place between 1808 and 1812. With the help of Britain, Spain fought against France and became free from French rule in 1812. Prussia and other German states started to strengthen themselves between 1807 and 1813. Austria declared war on France in 1809. \nIn Russia, Napoleon met the strongest and the most successful resistance. The 1812  \ncampaign to conquer Russia became the beginning of the end of the Napoleonic Empire. \nNapoleon began the war to conquer Russia with a giant army of 600 000 soldiers. The Russians mobilized a force of 400,000 troops. However, they chose to use the strategy of withdrawal and scorched-earth tactics rather than fight a major battle. Moreover, the Russian winter was unbearable to Napoleon's force.\nNevertheless, it contributed much to defeating Napoleon's Grand Army- Hunger, cold \nand disease defeated the French Army. When Napoleon occupied Moscow on September 14, 1812, he got it burned down and left it five weeks later. Napoleon was defeated and withdrew from Russia. At the Battle of Leipzig in Northern Germany, also known as the Battle of the Nations, European coalition forces of Russia, Britain, Sweden, Prussia, and Austria defeated Napoleon's retreating, tired and demoralized troops. Napoleon fled from Germany and went to France. \nThe European coalition forces occupied Paris and forced Napoleon to abdicate on March \n31, 1814. He was exiled to the Island of Elba. King Louis XVIII was put on the throne of France. However, Napoleon escaped from Elba and returned to France on March 20, 1815. He ruled France for one hundred more days.

The war was the insurrection fought between 1775 and 1783, through which 13(thirteen) of Great Britain's North American colonies threw off British rule to establish the sovereign United States of America. \nSince Columbus's discovery of the \"New World\" in 1492, people from Europe  \nbegan to inhabit, searching for a better life there. Nevertheless, these people gradually  \ndeveloped settled life as colonists and began to claim colonial territories in the \"New \nWorld\". Among Europeans, between 1607 and 1682, the British have succeeded in  \nestablishing thirteen colonies in North America. The struggle of these European settlers  \n(thirteen colonists) against British colonial rule for independence was coined in world history as the American War of Independence.

The settlement was the most comprehensive  \ntreaty that Europe had ever seen. The objective of the Congress of Vienna was to  \nprovide a long-term peace plan for Europe by settling critical issues arising from the French  \nRevolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars. As a result, virtually every state in Europe \nhad a delegation in Vienna.\nThe four powers (Austria, Prussia, Russia, and Great Britain) that were chiefly  \ninstrumental in the overthrow of Napoleon had concluded a special alliance among  \nthemselves with the Treaty of Chaumont on March 9, 1814, a month before Napoleon's \nfirst abdication. The subsequent peace treaties with France, signed on May 30 not only by the \"four\" but also by Sweden and Portugal and on July 20 by Spain, stipulated that all former belligerents should send plenipotentiaries to a congress in Vienna.

The delegates began to arrive in  \nVienna towards the end of September 1814. Klemen, principal minister of Austria,  \nrepresented his emperor, Francis II.  Tsar Alexander I of Russia directed his diplomacy.  King  \nFrederick William III of Prussia had Karl, Prince von Hardenberg, as his principal  \nminister. Great Britain was represented by its foreign minister, Viscount Castlereagh. \nHowever, when Castlereagh had to return to his parliamentary duties, the duke of  \nWellington replaced him, and Lord Clancarty was principal representative after the duke\u2019s departure. \nThe restored Louis XVIII of France sent Charles-Maurice de Talleyrand. Spain,  \nPortugal, and Sweden had only men of moderate ability to represent them. Many of the \nrulers of the minor states of Europe put in an appearance. With them came a host of courtiers, secretaries, and ladies to enjoy the magnificent social life of the Austrian court. Assisting Metternich as host, Friedrich Gentz played a vital role in the management of protocol and the secretarial organisation of the congress. The social side of the congress was, in fact, one of the causes of the long and unexpected delay in producing a result, for Metternich at least sometimes subordinated business to pleasure.\nThe major points of friction occurred over the disposition of Poland and Saxony, the \nconflicting claims of Sweden, Denmark, and Russia, and the adjustment of the borders of the German states. In general, Russia and Prussia were opposed by Austria, France and England, which at one point (January 3, 1815), went so far as to conclude a secret treaty of defensive alliance. The major final agreements and decisions of the congress were as follows.\nIn return for acquiring Poland, Alexander gave back Galicia to Austria and gave Thorn \nand a region around it to Prussia; Krak\u00f3w was made a free town. The rest of the Duchy of Warsaw was incorporated as a separate kingdom under the Russian emperor\u2019s  \nsovereignity. Prussia got two-fifths of Saxony and was compensated by extensive  \nadditions in Westphalia and on the left bank of the Rhine River. It was Castlereagh who insisted on Prussian acceptance of the latter territory, with which it had been suggested the king of Saxony should be compensated. \nCastlereagh wanted Prussia to guard the territories of the Rhine region against France and \nact as a buttress to the new Kingdom of the Netherlands, which comprised both the former United Provinces and Belgium. Austria was compensated by Lombardy and Venice and got back most of Tirol, Bavaria, Wurttemberg, and Baden, on the whole, did well. Hanover was also enlarged.

The Papal States were restored to the pope, and Naples went to the Sicilian Bourbons. Valuable articles were agreed to on the free navigation of international rivers and diplomatic precedence. Castlereagh\u2019s outstanding efforts to abolish the slave trade were rewarded only by a pious declaration.\nThe Final Act of the Congress of Vienna comprised all the agreements in one great  \ninstrument. It was signed on June 9, 1815, by the \u201ceight\u201d (except Spain, which refused as \na protest against the Italian settlement). All the other powers subsequently acceded to it. As a result, the political boundaries laid down by the Congress of Vienna lasted, except for one or two changes, for more than 40 years. The statesmen had successfully worked out the principle of a balance of power. \nHowever, the idea of nationality had been almost entirely ignored, necessarily so because \nit was not yet ready for expression. Territories had been bartered about without much reference to the wishes of their inhabitants. Until an even greater settlement took place at Versailles after World War I, it was customary for historians to condemn the statesmen of Vienna. It was later realized how difficult their task was, as was the fact that they secured for Europe a period of peace, which was its cardinal need. However, the statesmen failed to give to international relations any organ by which their work could be adapted to the new forces of the 19\nth century, and it was ultimately doomed to destruction.\n1.\u2002Explore the internet and discuss briefly the consequences of the \ncongress of Vienna.\n\uf03f"

Nevertheless, the  \nindustrial revolution was not the only factor for the emergence of modern  \ncapitalist society. \nA series of events occurred before the industrial revolution and contributed to \nthe growth and consolidation of capitalism. The earliest of these events was the English Revolution of the seventeenth century. The English revolution was a bourgeois revolution. It destroyed feudal autocracy and cleared the way for the rapid growth of capitalism in England. \nSimilar revolutions also took place in North America and France. In North \nAmerica, the revolution took the form of a war of Independence which was fought to liberate the 13 colonies of North America from British rule.  However, the war had results that were far beyond this objective. It created a new nation called the USA and facilitated the growth of capitalism in that new nation. \nThe American war of Independence also provided an immediate cause for the \nFrench revolution of 1789. In fact, before the American war of Independence, the intellectual movement called Enlightenment  had created a revolutionary  \nsituation in France. Thus, the two events inspired the French Revolution's  \noutbreak, which destroyed the old feudal system and stimulated rapid capitalist growth in France.\nThe French Revolution was important not only to France but also to the world. \nIt became a source for new ideas and principles like liberty and equality.  \nNapoleon's conquests spread these new ideas and principles to various  \ncorners of his European empire. However, his rule awakened nationalist feelings among the conquered peoples and states of Europe and finally brought about the  \ndownfall of the Napoleonic Empire.  Unit Summary\uf026"
